# Extraordinary Equipment

This document is intended to provide new item options for the WC5E project, ranging from altered prices for existing items due to the increased technological prowess of the races of Azeroth, to new mechanical equipment that relies more on scientific knowledge than magical enhancements, to new magical items found throughout the Warcraft setting, up to powerful artifacts.

This document is still very much a work in progress, with new items being added constantly as I come across new items that I feel should make their way into the setting.

</div>

#### Blunderbuss of Khaz Modan
A dwarven invention, for those who can't be satisfied with a weapon that isn't both a hammer and a gun. This weapon is made of a blunderbuss with a heavy hammer attachment, allowing it to be used as a maul. Switching between the two modes does not count as an action.

#### Dwarven Fishing Pole
Dwarves are not known for their subtlety.

#### Gnomish Net-o-Matic Projector
This device uses nets as ammunition. It launches the net using its range increment rather than the normal net range. When you roll a 1 on your d20 attack roll, you get caught in the net as it launches, attacking you instead. Reroll your attack roll against your own Armor Class to see if the attack hits.

#### Grappling Hook Launcher
[TODO]

#### Harpoon Gun
A harpoon gun uses special barbed javelins as ammunition, which can be retrieved as normal. The harpoon also comes with a spool of silk rope, 100 feet in length. When you fire this weapon, the harpoon becomes embedded in the target on a hit. You can make an opposing Strength (Athletics) check to pull the creature 10 feet closer to you as an action, and the creature must succeed at an opposing Strength (Athletics) check to move away from you.

#### Sniper Rifle
This gun is designed to be able to fire accurately at long distances by using more gunpowder in their bullets and rifling along the barrel. In exchange they have a lower rate of fire and can only be fired once per turn, even if other effects would allow the user to fire more often.

Sniper rifles use special ammunition called *heavy bullets* that are crafted separately from other bullet types. If crafted using the gunsmith's tools, you craft 3 + your proficiency bonus worth of heavy bullets over the span of a long rest.

## New Adventuring Gear
Item|Cost|Weight
----|----|------
Bayonet|2 gp|1 lb.
Goblin Army Knife|50 gp|4 lb.
Parachute|25 gp|12 lb.
Permanent Light|+50 gp|--
Phlogiston, liquid|20 gp|1/4 lb.
Pocket Watch|100 gp|--
Scope|100 gp|--
Suppressor|15 gp|--

#### Bayonet
A simple knife that can be attached to a crossbow or firearm, allowing them to be used as melee weapons. When making a melee attack with a weapon with a bayonet attached, the attack deals 1d6 piercing if the weapon has the two-handed property, or 1d4 piercing if it does not.

#### Goblin Army Knife
It’s not stylish and it’s useless as a weapon, but no sensible goblin warrior marches without this tool-of-all-trades. The goblin army knife digs trenches, saws wood, hammers nails, lights fires, sounds three different kinds of duck calls, polishes and oils armor, sews clothing, stores 25 feet of spidersilk rope with a test weight of 100 pounds, extends into a fishing rod, and unreels into a 1-person canvas tent. All this utility in just 4 pounds, and it even cuts things!

Accessing any of its functions takes 3 rounds.

*Source:* World of Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game

#### Parachute
A humanoid wearing this piece of gear can deploy the parachute as a reaction while falling, or as an action otherwise. The parachute requires at least a 10-foot cube of unoccupied space in which to deploy, and it doesn't open fast enough to slow a fall of less than 60 feet. If it has sufficient time and space to deploy properly, the parachute allows its wearer to land without taking falling damage. Once it has been used, the parachute takes 10 minutes to repack.

*Source:* Waterdeep: Dragon Heist

#### Permanent Light
Almost every culture has designed a light source that can act indefinitely without fuel. The night elves bind wisps to cages of flora, the draenei and blood elves uses glowing crystals, the gnomes used electricity-powered glowing filaments... Whatever the source, the cost is the same.

A permanent light is an addition added to another form of light such as a torch or lantern. Add the cost of a permanent light to the item to determine the cost and weight.

#### Phlogiston, liquid
Odorless, weightless, and almost undetectable — it makes steam technology practical by speeding combustion and increasing the heat produced by steam boilers. In addition to its application in technological devices, phlogiston has found use in elixirs that alter the imbiber’s abilities for a short time. Many technological devices use phlogiston as fuel.

#### Pocket Watch
A relatively delicate item, this small clockwork invention keeps perfect time as long as it is wound regularly. 

#### Scope
A specialized spyglass that can be affixed to the top of a two-handed firearm or crossbow. When you take a bonus action to aim through the scope, your next attack this turn against a creature at long range does not have disadvantage. If you already do not have disadvantage on attacks versus creatures at long range, you instead have advantage on the attack roll.

In addition, you can use the scope as a standard spyglass.

#### Suppressor
Any firearm can be affixed with a suppressor. Doing so takes 1 minute. The weapon makes no sound and light when used, and thus, ignores the booming sound rules. In exchange, the range of the weapon is halved.

# Mechanical Items

Mechanical items are those made through advanced scientific knowledge instead of magical enchantments. Some low-level items are considered simple equipment and can be found in the above section. Others however take specialized knowledge and advanced materials to craft, and are found below.

Mechanical items are not magical items as therefore those that deal damage are not considered magical weapons. They follow the standard rarity rules and are classified under existing magical item categories, such as potions or wondrous items, for ease of integration with existing rulesets. 

With very rare exceptions they do not occupy attunement slots. Instead each has a chance at malfunctioning after being used, due to the prototype nature of the equipment. This prevents the equipment from being abused. When an item regains its uses, it rarely does so out of an internal recharge mechanic, but rather through the player refueling and performing maintenance on the item. Fuel is not tracked, except for very large and complex items such as a *sky golem*.

#### Advanced Refrigeration Unit
*Wondrous item, common*

This chest-sized box is constantly filled with cold air, helping chill items that are placed inside. A dial on the side allows the temperature of the air to be adjusted from a couple of degrees above freezing to a couple below.

#### Arcane Bomb
*Wondrous item, rare*

This grenade is made using the bile of a blue dragon, carrying some of their breath effects. You can throw this grenade as an action, targeting a point within 30 feet. Each creature in a 20-foot radius from that point must make a DC 17 Wisdom save or lose spell slots of a combined level of 1d4+1, starting with the highest available spell slot. For every spell level they lost, they take 1d10 + 4 points of psychic damage.

#### The Big One
*Wondrous item, legendary*

This bomb is the pinnacle of goblin explosive technology. It is a massive, 3-foot diameter spiked red ball weighing around 200 pounds. You can detonate this device as an action or set it on a timer of up to 1 hour. While on a timer, it emits a ticking noise that can be heard up to 20 feet away. 

When it detonates, it deals 20d6 fire, 10d6 thunder, and 10d6 radiant damage to all creatures in a 80-foot radius sphere, Dexterity save DC 19 for half. The blast can be seen and heard up to 5 miles away. Each creature that can see or hear the explosion must make a Constitution saving throw or gain a condition, based on how far away they are from the center of the blast:

Distance|Save DC|Effects
--------|-------|-------
1280 to 641 feet|11|Blinded for 1 minute
640 to 321 feet|12|Blinded and deafened for 10 minutes
320 to 161 feet|13|Blinded, deafened, and stunned for 1 hour
160 feet or less|14|Blinded and deafened permanently, stunned for 24 hours

The detonation turns the area of effect into difficult terrain and is considered extreme heat weather for 24 hours. It damages  This duration is reduced by half if the weather is cold or arctic cold.

The Big One is remarkably stable for goblin technology, and does not have a chance of malfunction.

#### Deepdive Helmet
*Wondrous item, common*

This oversized helmet allows a creature to breathe underwater. In order to do so, it needs a supply of air that is fed through thick rubber hoses on the side. These hoses reach up to 50 feet before connecting to a pump source that sits on the surface of the water or a weighted balloon that can hold up to 4 hours of air.

Advanced versions of this helmet come with backpacks that can filter oxygen out of the water. Such devices are *uncommon* items instead.

#### Depth Charge
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This weighted canister can activated and set on a timer as an action. The timer can last for up to 1 minute, after which it explodes and deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures within 5 feet. In the water, this item is considerably more deadly and deals 5d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures and objects within 10 feet.

The depth charge can be thrown as an action with a range of up to 20 feet. If tossed into the water, it sinks at a rate of 10 feet per round.

#### Dimensional Ripper
*Wondrous item, legendary*

This goblin device rips open dimensional barriers to open a 5-foot diameter *gate* that allows transportation to a location anywhere on any plane. This gate is opaque, preventing the user from seeing to the other side and lasts for 1 round before closing. After the dimensional ripper has been used, it cannot be used again for 24 hours.

In order to use the device, you must spend 10 minutes carefully entering the spatial and the planar coordinates into the device and making one or two Intelligence (Arcana) checks: one for the spatial coordinates and one for the planar coordinates. 

\pagebreakNum

You can attempt to rush the activation to 1 minute, but this increases the DC of the check. You do not know the DC of the coordinates or the result of your roll, which is determined secretly by the DM. 

If you have a coordinate code punchcard, you automatically succeed at this check if you do not rush the activation. If you fail the check, you are transported to a random location. 

Planar coordinates are more finicky: If you fail to enter a proper set of planar coordinates, the portal fails to form. If you enter in the wrong set of planar coordinates, roll a d20. On a 1, the portal opens but to a different plane. 

The dimensional ripper comes with coordinate analyzers that display the current spatial and planar coordinates, allowing shorter jaunts to be more accurate. If your check is not high enough, a mishap occurs. Each creature that passes through the portal must roll a d6 and determine which mishap affects them.

The DCs for dimensional coordinates are noted in the Dimensional Coordinate DC table. If you attempt to transport to a different plane and lack proper spatial coordinates for that plane, you end up at a random spot on that plane. Otherwise, check for the Dimensional Ripper Accuracy table to see how close you arrive to your designated coordinates.

##### Dimensional Coordinate DC
DC|Target Location
--|--
0|Current Location
0|Location of punchcard coordinates
5|Within 1 mile
10|Within 10 miles
15|Within 100 miles
20|On same plane
25|On another plane
+10|On adjacent plane (such as the Emerald Dream)
+10|Rushed activation

##### Dimensional Ripper Accuracy
Check Result<br>vs DC|Effect
---|---
+5 or more|Arrive at coordinates, no mishap
+0 to +4|Arrive at coordinates, mishap
-1 to -5|Off target (as teleport), mishap
-6 or more|Similar area (as teleport), mishap

\columnbreak

##### Dimensional Ripper Mishap
d6|Mishap
--|-----
1|You are set on fire. You take 1d4 fire damage each round until you take an action to extinguish the flame.
2|You are *polymorphed* into a random creature of the same type for 1 hour.
3|You are replaced with your evil twin for 1 hour. You gain (or lose) a goatee and your alignment shifts to its opposite.
4|You are transported to the target location but arrive 1d6 times 10 feet in the air.
5|Roll a d6. On an odd roll, you are affected by the enlarge version of *enlarge/reduce* for 1 hour (no conventration). On an even roll, you are affected by the reduce version instead.
6|Roll twice on this table, ignoring this effect and duplicate effects.

#### Exploding Ammunition
*Weapon (ammunition), uncommon*

This ammunition can be fired from a standard projectile weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 fire damage and 1d6 thunder damage. On a miss, the ammunition explodes in a random square near the target. When the ammunition explodes, it can be heard up to 200 feet away.

#### Explosive Decoy
*Wondrous item, rare*

This device includes a small holoprojector that allows it to project an illusion of a creature on itself. It can also make simple noises. 

You can set up an explosive decoy as an action, causing it to take on your appearance and mimicing your voice that repeats a single phrase every other round. If you set it up over the span of a minute, you can alter it to appear as another creature. You cannot cause it to look like a specific creature unless that creature is present and cooperates. 

A creature who is nearby can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check to determine that the effect is an illusion, though this does not allow them to see through it. When the illusion is broken by being touched or attacked, the device explodes and deals 8d6 fire damage to all creatures within 20 feet or half with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. 

The device can keep up its illusion for 10 minutes before shutting down and needing to be redeployed. It can be retrieved as an action by someone who knows that it is an illusion.

If any lightning damage is dealt to any creature or object within 20 feet, the electromagnetic disturbance causes the device to prematurely explode if it has been activated.

\pagebreakNum

#### Explosive Sheep
*Wondrous item, rare*

You can unfold this metal box into a ball of woolen fluff and explosives as an action. Designate a target or square within 600 feet. The sheep has its own turn immediately after yours and will move at 60 feet per turn on the most direct path until it reaches the target. If the target cannot be reached within 1 minute, the sheep deactivates and needs to be redeployed.

When the sheep reaches its target, it explodes and deals 8d6 fire damage to all creatures within 20 feet, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. It also explodes if dealt at least 10 points of damage; it has an Armor Class of 15.

#### EZ-Throw Dynamite
*Wondrous item, rare*

This small box is filled with small red sticks of explosive. Each stick has a sticky patch on the side allowing them to be quickly bundled together and a small dial and button on top. A found box of EZ-Throw Dynamite has 3d6 + 8 sticks remaining.

You can use an action to grab a stick of dynamite, set the timer and press the activation button, then throw the dynamite at a square up to 60 feet away. If the timer is not set, it detonates when it arrives at the location. Otherwise it detonates after the timer runs out, up to 6 rounds later at the beginning of your turn.

When a single stick of dynamite explodes, it deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage to each creature within 5 feet of the square it occupies, half on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. If you throw multiple sticks stuck together, each additional stick causes the explosion to deal an extra 1d6 damage (up to 10d6), increases the radius by 5 feet (up to 20 feet), and increases the saving throw DC by 1 (up to 15).

#### Goblin Army Boots
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

These boots are heavy and unwieldy. You reduce your movement speed by half and have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws while wearing them. In exchange, you cannot set off any pressure-sensitive traps.

#### Goblin Bomb Dispenser
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

You can activate this backpack-shaped item as a bonus action. Inside the pack, a bombling is assembled, ready for use at the beginning of your next turn. When the bombling is ready, you can use your action to designate a target square within 25 feet. The bombling will then move to that location and immediately detonate. If you do not use the assembled bombling on the turn that it become available, the mechanisms in the device disassemble it for future use.

A newly created bomb dispenser has enough parts to create 2d6 + 6 bomblings before becoming useless. When you use this device, roll a d20. On a 1, the bombling prematurely detonates in your square.

\columnbreak

#### Goblin Construction Helmet
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

When you wear this helmet, you have a shield against fire damage. Treat this as a pool of temporary hit points that are tracked separately and only apply towards fire damage. This pool equals 24 hit points, which refill at the rate of 1 per hour. Any fire damage in excess of this amount applies to you, as normal.

#### Goblin Dragon Gun
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

A dragon gun is a goblin-made flamethrower. It carries a risk of malfunction each time you use it.

As an action, you can cause the dragon gun to project fire in a 10-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Each time you use the dragon gun, roll a d10 and add the number of times you have used it since your last long rest. If the total is 11 or higher, the dragon gun malfunctions: you take 4d6 fire damage, and you can't use the dragon gun again until you finish a long rest.

#### Goblin Glider
*Wondrous item, common*

This cloak includes a small button in the cowl that can be used to deploy telescoping legs, causing the cloak to unfurl into something that appears like a bat's wings.

You can deploy the wings as a reaction when falling. Your falling speed is immediately reduced to half its normal speed. As you fall, you move forward 2 feet for every 1 foot that you fall vertically. You treat the distance that you fall as half the normal distance, and the maximum damage you can take from falling is 10d6.

Once a goblin glider has been deployed, you take up the space of a Large creature and continue to do so until you remove the glider or take 1 minute to put the glider back into its cloak mode.

#### Goblin Jumper Cables
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

You can attach the thick yellow cables of this battery to a creature that has died in the last minute. As an action, you can send a massive burst of electricity into their corpse and watch the body jerks off the ground and spasm mightily while electricity plays over the thinly insulated cables, causing the smell of burning hair to waft up. In addition to being fun to watch, this display sometimes revives the character.

When you use the device, the creature is restore to life with 0 hit points and begins making death saves again. Once a set of goblin jumper cables has been used, it needs to recharge over the next 24 hours.

#### Goblin Land Mine
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

[TODO]

#### Goblin Mining Helmet
*Wondrous item, common*

This helmet has a small flashlight on the front. It also provides resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning damage from falling rocks.

#### Goblin Mortar
*Wondrous item, rare*

A more portable version of the heavy dwarven mortar. A mortar has a chance of a misfire every time you use it.

You can use two firing modes for the mortar. Each one charges the weapon by a certain amount. After you fire the weapon, roll a d10 and add the number of charges in the mortar to the amount. If the result is 14 or higher, the mortar misfires: you take 4d6 fire damage, and the mortar cannot be used again until the next dawn.

***Molten Spray.*** You can add 1 charge as an action to loose a 30-foot cone of molten metal. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Bombard.*** You can add 3 charges as an action to launch a hail of molten projectiles in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Goblin Rocket Boots
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

When you click your heels together as a bonus action to activate these boots, your speed is boosted to 100 feet. While these boots are active, you cannot move less than 50 feet per round. You can end the effect as a non-action at the end of each turn.

At the end of each turn that the boots are active, roll a d10 and add the number of rounds the boots have been active since your last long rest. On a 12 or higher, the device malfunctions. Roll a d10. On a 1, the rocket boots explode, dealing 1d4 fire damage to you and the boots are destroyed.

#### Goblin Rocket Helmet
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

You can activate this item as a bonus action. When you do, you are moved up to 30 feet in a straight line at a target. When you end your movement, you make a single melee attack against the target, dealing 1d4 + 3 bludgeoning damage on a hit. Additionally, if the target is a creature, they must make a DC 13 Strength save or be knocked prone. You must make a DC 13 Constitution save or be stunned until the end of your turn.

Each time you use this helmet, roll a d10 and add one to the total for every time you have used the helmet in the last hour. On a 11 or higher, the helmet overheats and cannot be used again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Goblin Rocket Launcher
*Wondrous item, rare*

You can fire this rocket launcher as an action at a target up to 150 feet away. Make an attack roll with a +10 to hit. On a hit, the target takes 8d6 fire damage and 2d6 piercing damage and must make a DC 17 Constitution save or be knocked prone and stunned for 1 round. 

When you use this device, make a DC 13 Strength save. On a failure, you are knocked prone.

#### Goblin Sapper Charge
*Wondrous item, rare*

You can detonate this item as an action or set it on a timer that lasts for up to 10 minutes. When it explodes, it acts as a 5th-level *fireball* centered on the charge (DC 17). This effect deals double damage to objects and structures.

#### Goblin Welder Beam
[TODO: Can restore hp to a mechanical, or fire damage to a creature.]

#### Goggles

\pagebreakNum

#### Gnomish Alarm-o-Bot
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

A gnomish alarm-o-bot must be prepared, keying it to respond to your voice. This process takes 10 minutes. After it has been prepped, activating an alarm-o-bot is an action and it remains active for up to 24 hours or until it drops to 0 hit points. You can break the duration of operation up into 10 minute increments. 

It is friendly to you and your companions. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In absence of orders, it stands in place and actively searches for creatures.

#### Gnomish Battle Chicken
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

A gnomish battle chicken must be prepared, keying it to respond to your voice. This process takes 10 minutes. After it has been prepped, activating a battle chicken is an action and it remains active for up to 8 hours or until it drops to 0 hit points. You can break the duration of operation up into 10 minute increments. 

It is friendly to you and your companions. You can use a bonus action to command how the chicken moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In absence of orders, it acts as a chicken would.

#### Gnomish Cloaking Device
[TODO. Invisibility while granting see invisibility. Invisibility does not apply to other invisible creatures.]

\pagebreakNum

#### Gnomish Death Ray
*Wondrous item, rare*

This device can hold up to 10 charges. In order to charge it, you must expend a hit die; each hit die expended adds one charge to the death ray. If you attempt to add an 11th charge, the device expends all charges, dealing 5d6 + 20 force damage to you.

As an action, you can point the death ray at a target you can see within 60 feet and pull the trigger to launch a thin green beam, expending all charges. The target must make a Dexterity save (DC 15) or take 1d6 + 4 force damage per charge, to a maximum of 10d6 + 40 force damage. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated. 

A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.

If you target a nonmagical object made of organic material, it is automatically disintegrated. If you expend 1 charge, this disintegrates a Tiny or smaller sized object. The size of object automatically disintegrated increases as more charges are expended: Small or smaller with 2 charges, Medium or smaller with 5 charges, and Large or smaller with 10 charges. Otherwise it disintegrates a 1 foot cube of material per charge.

#### Gnomish Flame Turret
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

You can deploy this device as an action. It becomes a Tiny object that occupies your space, has an AC of 15 and 5 hit points and is immune to poison damage, psychic damage, and all conditions. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). The turret remains active until it runs out of charges or until reduced to 0 hit points.

The turret has a maximum of 10 charges. Each vial of alchemist's fire you add to the turret's storage tank adds 1 charge.

If you are within 60 feet of it, you can use your bonus action to designate a target up to 60 feet away from the target. The turret expends a charge and launches a bolt of flame with a +4 bonus on the attack roll against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage as if struck by alchemist's fire. The turret will continue to launch bolts of flame until commanded to stop as a bonus action, another target is designated, or if it runs out of charges. It will even continue to attack if its target is reduced to 0 hit points.

#### Gnomish Harm Prevention Belt
*Wondrous item, rare*

You can activate this belt as an action to gain resistance to all damage for 1 minute. Every time you activate the belt, and each time you take damage while it is active, it gains a charge. 

Every time the belt gains a charge, roll a d10 and add the number of charges in the belt to the amount. If the result is 15 or higher, the belt backfires, transporting you into the Ethereal Plane for 1 minute. At the end of this duration, you are returned to the material plane. Once the belt backfires, you cannot use it again until the next dawn.

#### Gnomish Lightning Generator
[TODO: Fires bolt of lightning. Being made of all metal, chance of shock.]

#### Gnomish Mind Control Cap
*Wondrous item, very rare*

You can use the focusing dish on this cap to project the power of your mind, attempting to override the will of another. Make an opposing Intelligence check with advantage against a humanoid you can see within 60 feet. Upon a success, they are under the effects of the *dominate person* spell as long as you maintain concentration, up to 1 minute.

You can safely use a Gnomish Mind Control Cap only once per short or long rest. If you attempt to use it a second time, you take 1d12 psychic damage from the mental strain. This damage cannot be reduced or avoided in any way. Each additional time you use the cap, the damage increases by one die: 2d12 for a third use, 3d12 for a fourth use, etc.

#### Gnomish Poultryizer
*Wondrous item, very rare*

You can fire this gun-shaped device at a target within 60 feet that you can see. The target is affected by the *polymorph* spell for 1 hour (DC 15, no concentration required), turning into the form of a chicken.

Every time you fire the device, roll a d10 and add the number of times you have fired the weapon since your last long rest. On a 11 or higher, the polarity reverses and you are affected by the device instead (no save). Once the polarity has reversed, you cannot use the poultryizer again until you finish a long rest.

#### Gnomish Rocket Boots
*Wondrous item, rare*

When you click your heels together as a bonus action to activate these boots, your speed is boosted to 100 feet. While these boots are active, you cannot move less than 50 feet per round. You can end the effect as a non-action at the end of each turn.

At the end of each turn that the boots are active, roll a d10 and add the number of rounds the boots have been active since your last long rest. On a 14 or higher, the device malfunctions and ceases to function. Roll a d10. On a 1, you are under the effects of the *confusion* spell for your turn. On a 10, your speed is reduced to 0 feet for 3 rounds. Otherwise, the boots simply fail to function.

#### Gnomish Shrink Ray
*Wondrous item, uncommon* 

You can fire this gun-shaped device at a target within 60 feet that you can see. The target is affected by the "reduce" version of the *enlarge/reduce* spell for 1 minute (DC 13, no concentration required).

Every time you fire the device, roll a d10 and add the number of times you have fired the weapon since your last long rest. On a 11 or higher, the energy releases in a random burst. Roll a d4. On a 1-2, you are affected by the "reduce" version of the spell. On a 3-4, the target is affected by the "enlarge" version of the spell instead. In either case, the weapon cannot be used again until you finish a long rest.

#### Gnomish Universal Remote
*Wondrous item, rare*

You can use this complex device as an action, causing an invisible beam to strike a construct that you can see within 60 feet. The creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom save or be affected by *dominate beast*, except only affecting constructs and ignoring immunity to the charmed condition. The effect has a duration of 1 hour and does not require concentration, though you can only control one creature at a time. Issuing a command is an action, unless you pass a DC 13 Intelligence (tinker's tools) check, in which case it is a bonus action.

Each time you use the device to attempt to control a construct, roll a d10 and add the number of times you have used the device since your last long rest. On a 11 or higher, the device instead superpowers the construct, causing them to have advantage on attack rolls for 1 minute or until you assert control.

#### Gnomish X-Ray Specs
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing these goggles, you can use an action to press a button and activate them. When you do so, you can see into and through solid matter for 1 minute. This vision has a radius of 30 feet. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don't prevent light from passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.

Whenever you use the goggles again before taking a long rest, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.

#### Gnomish World Enlarger
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

You can activate this device as an action to gain the benefits of the "reduce" version of the *enlarge/reduce* spell for 1d10 minutes, no concentration required. This effect stacks with other similar effects but not with itself.

Every time you use this device, roll a d10 and add the number of times you have used the device since your last long rest. On a 11 or higher, the device malfunctions. You are shrunk for 24 hours; roll a d10. On a 1, roll a d4 and your height is reduced by that many inches permanently. In any case, the device ceases to function until your next long rest.

#### Gnomish World Shrinker
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

You can activate this device as an action to gain the benefits of the "enlarge" version of the *enlarge/reduce* spell for 1d10 minutes, no concentration required. This effect stacks with other similar effects but not with itself.

*Potion, XXX rarity*

[Todo.] You deal +1d4 damage per creature from all sources but take +1d4 damage from all sources.

#### Flask of Fortification
*Potion, rare*

When you drink this potion, your current and maximum hit points increase. The amount of this increase is equal to two of your highest hit die. For example, a level 5 character with 3 levels in hunter and 2 levels in mage would increase their current and maximum points by 20. This increase lasts for 1 hour. The bright green liquid of this potion shimmers in the light.

#### Focusing Draught

When you drink this mildly alcoholic beverage, your mind becomes focused. If you are a character with the Focus class ability, you gain two focus points, up to your normal maximum. If you do not have this ability, you are not able to properly handle the mental strain. Instead you have advantage on the next Intelligence or Wisdom ability check that you perform before the end of your turn. At the beginning of your next turn, you are stunned for one round.

#### Kaja'Cola
[Todo. Inspiration mechanic.]

#### Noggenfogger Elixir
*Potion, uncommon*

***"Drink me."***

This elixir was created and trademarked by Marin Noggenfogger. Most commonly sold in packs of six, the odd mix of ingredients has led to incredibly odd results. When you drink this potion, roll a d6 and consult the table below for its effect. If you drink another elixir while already under the effects of one, alternate effects stack. If you roll the same result, the duration of the current effect is extended. The elixir is a dark green, resembling an oil at first glance. It is so thick that some feel imbibing it is more like eating an oyster -- the stuff must be swallowed whole.

d6|Result
---|---
1-2|A puff of smoke covers you and when it clears you find that your flesh has fallen off your bones, turning you into a skeleton. You are still technically alive, but do not need to breathe. The transformation lasts for 10 minutes.
3-4|You are under the effects of reduce, as if enlarge/reduce were cast on you. The effect lasts for 10 minutes, and you do not need to concentrate on the effect to maintain it.
5-6|You feel oddly buoyant. You are under the effects of feather fall for 10 minutes.

#### Noth's Special Brew
*Potion, uncommon*

This potion is made from the skulls of dead humanoids, twisted by Noth the Plaguebringer into a powerful brew of undeath. Any death knight who drinks this potion regains 2 expended runic power dice.

To others, this potion does not provide nearly the same benefit. To anyone else the potion instead acts as a *potion of poison*. The potion's black liquid has swirling dark gray clouds, which occasionally form into screaming skulls.

\pagebreakNum
#### Pandaren Brews
*Potions, rarity varies*

Pandaren brews follow the rules for potions, but instead of being found or sold in small single-dose vials, pandaren brews are found in kegs or bottles and provide multiple doses. A keg of pandaren brew can be drunk 20 times and an unopened bottle can be drunk 10 times.

***Bravery Brew (rare).*** This brew establishes a feeling of camaraderie and kinship and is a favorite of dwarven battle companies. If at least four creatures drink a dose from this keg, they are immune to the frightened condition and gain 5 temporary hit points each round as long as they can see at least one of their drinking companions. The benefits from this drink last for 10 minutes.

***Black Whiskey (uncommon).*** This bottle of brew can be drunk to blend into the shadows. After 1 sip, you remain invisible for up to 30 minutes. If you move, the effect ends. If you take at least 4 sips, you become invisible and are able to move for 10 minutes but take a -2 penalty on Dexterity-based checks and saving throws for the duration. The bottle holds 12 sips instead of 10.

***Chou's Hair of the Dog Ale (uncommon).*** After downing a mug of this keg of ale, you can ignore 1 level of exhaustion and can use *detect magic* at will. The benefits of this last for 4 hours.

***Chou's Steadying Cider (rare).*** This brew was developed by a pandaren brewmaster who hated the Scourge and the terror and ugliness they spread. For the next 24 hours after you drink from this keg, you automatically know if there is an undead within 60 feet of you. This is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. 

Additionally, you have advantage on saves versus the frightened condition and resistance to necrotic damage for 1d4 hours.

***Drunken Master's Secret Tonic (common).*** When you drink from this bottle, you appear inebriated for the next hour. This does not actually get you drunk, merely giving you the swaying motion of someone completely sloshed.

***Firebelly Ale (uncommon).*** This pepper-flavored ale leaves an uncomfortable churning in your gut. After taking a swig from this keg, you can use a bonus action to let out a fiery belch that deals 2d6 fire damage to a creature within 5 feet. You can do so up to 3 times and the benefits of this ale last for 1 minute.

***Hong's Fighting Lager (uncommon).*** When you drink a swig of this keg of ale as part of a short rest, you remove one level of exhaustion. If you drink the ale as a full-round action while frightened or sickened, the effect is suppressed for the duration or for 1d6 hours, whichever is shorter. Drinking the ale in a thirsty frenzy provides no benefits.

***Wounded Warrior's Whiskey (rare).*** For each swig of this bottle, you restore 1d4 hit points. If you drink at least 4 swigs of this whiskey, you gain a +1 bonus on melee attack and damage rolls and your maximum hit points increase by 1 per level for 1d4 hours. If you drink all 10 swigs of this whiskey, these bonuses increase to +3 and 3 hit points per level and you gain immunity to the charmed and frightened conditions; these benefits last for 1d6 hours. For each swig of whiskey you take, you gain a -1 penalty to initiative rolls and Dexterity saving throws until the effects expire.

*Potion, rarity varies*

When you drink this potion, you regain an amount of expended mana. The amount recovered depends on the potion's rarity, as shown on the Potions of Mana table. Any mana regained in excess of your normal maximum are lost. Whatever its potency, the potion's blue liquid lets off a faint blue light.

#### Potion of Rage
*Potion, uncommon*

When you drink this potion, you are enraged. A character with the Inner Rage class feature gains two rage points. Others who imbibe this potion cannot properly handle the infuriating power and instead attack recklessly, causing attack rolls against them to have advantage for 1 minute. The blood red liquid of this potion causes whatever container it fills to gain cracks, though it does not actually damage the container.

#### Thistle Tea
*Potion, uncommon*

When you drink this bitter tea, you are infused with energy. A character with the Energy class ability gains two points of energy, up to their max total. Others who drink this tea are instead filled with a jittery energy that quickly burns out. Your movement speed increases by 10 feet until the end of your next turn, after which you gain a level of exhaustion.

#### Troll's Blood Elixir
*Potion, rarity varies*

When you drink this potion, you gain the ability to regain lost hit points over time. You regain a number of hit points per round based on the elixir's rarity, as shown on the Troll's Blood Elixir table. The effects of this potion last for 1 hour. You regain these hit points at the start of each of your turns, starting the turn after you first take damage. The opaque, dark green liquid of this potion gradually expands to fill the confines of its container, though only one vial's worth of potion is usable.

If you fail to avoid the effect, you take damage equal to 16 x the number of charges in the staff.

[Todo. Polearm. Diseases target for X damage and another X damage over 10 sec.] This long-handled halberd has a narrow, razor-sharp blade and wickedly barbed tip that bears a faintly glowing, sickly green aura. The shaft is wrapped in dried skin peeled from the corpses of zombies. The faint odor of rotting eggs surrounds the wielder in combat. These nasty-looking and nasty-smelling items are not a favorite among the living for obvious reasons.

#### Bloodmoon
[Todo. 2H Axe. ???]

#### Brain Hacker
[Todo. 2H Axe. Intelligence debuff.]

#### Corrupted Ashbringer
*Weapon (greatsword), legendary (requires attunement)*

While you are attuned to this weapon, your Constitution score is reduced by 2. Additionally, you gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls and you deal a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 when you attack with this magic weapon. 

Whenever you score a critical hit, the sword deals an additional 2d6 points of necrotic damage and heals you for the amount of this damage dealt. When you bring a creature to 0 hit points with the sword, the creature's body is disintegrated.

***Sentience.*** Corrupted Ashbringer is a sentient neutral evil weapon with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is deep and echoing, accompanied by a second voice in the background. While you are attuned to it, Corrupted Ashbringer also understands every language you know.

***Personality.*** Corrupted Ashbringer speaks slowly, with pauses between words. Its spirit is that of the former paladin Alexandros Mograine, who was killed by his sone by his own sword, corrupting it from the former weapon of the Light, Ashbringer. He was later risen as a death knight, which bound his soul to his former blade.

The spirit sword hates his son Renault, the Scarlet Crusade, the Burning Legion, and the Scourge. It spends its time reminiscing on its former life, talking to itself and nurturing its hatred. This hatred drives it to wish the destruction of its above enemies by any means necessary, including taking steps that include the deaths of thousands of innocent lives.

Despite this it holds a certain fondness for the paladins of the Silver Hand, of whom Alexandros was a former Highlord. If the wielder attempts to fight them, or if they do not regularly work to bring about the end of its enemies, a conflict occurs. However, part of its corruption came at the hands of the Scourge, so it grudgingly tolerates the Scourge due to the Lich King's influence.

*Weapon (greataxe), very rare*

Gorehowl is the legendary two-handed axe of the Hellscream family of orcs. The sharply curved axe head, with an intricate series of grooves in it, is massive, well worn, and permanently stained with old blood.

#### Arcane Cannon
*Wondrous item, very rare*

This Large cannon is imbued with magic. It requires no ammunition and doesn't need to be loaded. It takes one action to aim the cannon and one action to fire it. After the cannon has fired, it must recharge for 5 minutes before it can be fired again.

The creature firing the cannon chooses the effect from the following options:

***Acid Jet.*** The cannon discharges acid in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a creature that fails its saving throw takes 11 (2d10) acid damage at the start of each of its turns; a creature can end this damage by using its action to wash off the acid with a pint or more of water.

***Fire Jet.*** The cannon discharges fire in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

***Frost Shot.*** The cannon shoots a ball of frost to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The ball then expands to form a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (4d10) cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and its speed isn't reduced. A creature whose speed is reduced by this effect can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Lightning Shot.*** The cannon shoots a ball of lightning to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The lightning then expands to form a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures wearing metal armor have disadvantage on the save.

***Poison Spray.*** The cannon expels poison gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (4d10) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned. A creature poisoned in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

#### Dragonbreath Chili
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This bowl of deep red chili is always warm to the touch and bubbles ominously. When you eat this hellishly spicy chili, the suffering from the spices does not end once the chili leaves your tongue. It percolates in your stomach for the next hour, occasionally causing you to belch out bursts of flame. Once per minute, or whenever you are struck by an attack, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, you automatically belch forth a blast of flame, dealing fire damage in a 15-foot cone. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed Dexterity save, and half as much on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your Proficiency bonus.

This effect can be ended early by either neutralizing the chili as if it were an ingested poison, or by completely submerging your head in water for one round.

#### Orbs of Infusion
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

Orbs of infusion are fist-sized orbs that float a few inches above the ground when not attended. When you attune to an orb of infusion, you must designate a single weapon that you own for it to affect. After 10 minutes, the orb becomes attached to the weapon, orbiting around it, and cannot be removed unless you detach it as an action or the weapon is destroyed. Not even an *antimagic field* causes it to fall off. The orb does fall off if your attunement ends.

Each orb causes your attacks with that weapon to deal an additional 1d4 damage. You can also swing the weapon in place of an attack to launch a bolt of energy at a target within 120 feet, using your normal melee attack modifiers. On a hit, it deals 3d4 damage.

The type of damage dealt by the orb is determined by the type of orb. Additionally, each orb has a unique effect associated with it. The types of orbs are detailed below.

***Orb of Arcana.*** A translucent opal sphere. It deals force damage. When a creature is damaged by this weapon or its ranged attack, they must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Orb of Corruption.*** A diamond crudely carved into the form of a skull. It deals psychic damage. When a creature is damaged by this weapon or its ranged attack, they must make a DC 13 Charisma save. On a failure, attacks against them have advantage until the beginning of your next turn.

***Orb of Darkness.*** A sphere of polished obsidian. It deals necrotic damage. When you reduce a Small or Medium humanoid or beast creature to 0 hit points with damage from this item, the creature rises as a zombie under your control at the end of your next turn. It has 1 hit point and remains animated for 1 minute. You can only have one zombie under your control at a time. 

***Orb of Fire.*** A sapphire sphere glowing with an inner flame. It deals fire damage. Whenever you hit a target with attacks from this item, each enemy creature adjacent to the target also takes 1d4 fire damage. They can make a DC 13 Dexterity save for half damage. Flammable objects in the area are ignited if they are not worn or carried.

***Orb of Frost.*** A sphere of smooth, ice-cold topaz. It deals cold damage. When you deal damage with this item, the target must make a DC 13 Constitution save. On a failure, their movement speed is reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. This does not stack with itself.

#### Saronite Warplate
*Armor (heavy or medium, but not hide), rare*

Saronite warplate is light but not flexible. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the saronite version doesn't. While wearing saronite armor, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit. 
 
If you are stuck by an effect that deals at least one die of radiant damage, part of that energy is deflected. Each creature within reach of you must make a DC 13 Dexterity save or take an amount of radiant damage equal to the number of dice in the original damaging effect. 

*For example:* A character wearing saronite armor is struck by a paladin's _crusader's strike_, taking 2d8 radiant damage. Then every creature within 5 feet of the character must make a save or take 3 radiant damage. If a second character wearing saronite armor was standing next to the first and failed their Dexterity save, they would take the radiant damage but that damage would not cause another damage deflection, as the number of dice rolled was 0.

***Cursed.*** A person who wears or carries saronite warplate is subject to the Curse of Yogg-Saron. See the sidebar under the Shadowmourne article in the Legendary Weapons of Azeroth section for details. Saronite warplate is weaker than the primordial saronite that makes up Shadowmourne, having a DC of 13 instead.

See the Sandstone Drake stat block before for the relevant stats.

### Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guaardian

_Staff, legendary (requires attunement by a druid, mage, priest, or warlock)_

This staff can be used as a spellcasting focus, and can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class and saving throws. 

***Raven Friend.*** When attuned to the staff, ravens consider the bearer to be a member of their species and are considered charmed, though this effect breaks if the bearer attacks the raven. Ravens often think of the bearer as a curiosity, and the staff-holder will find that there are often ravens who follow them around. Other species related to ravens, such as dread ravens and the arakkoa, are too intelligent or powerful to be affected by this ability. 

Additionally, The bearer can cast _speak with animals_ and _animal messenger_ as rituals, though they can only affect ravens.

***Raven Form.*** As an action, you can shapeshift into a raven form, using the rules for a druid's shapeshift ability listed in the Warcraft Hero's Handbook. See below for raven form stats.

> ### Raven Form
> _Tiny beast_
> ___
>  - **Armor Class** 10 + Dexterity modifier
>  - **Speed** 10 ft., fly 50 ft.
> ___
> - ***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
> - ***Flyby.*** You don't provoke opportunity attacks when you fly out of an enemy's reach.
> - ***Keen Sight.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
> - ***Mimicry.*** You can speak as normal and can mimic sounds you have heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds you make can tell they are imitations with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check opposed by your Charisma (Deception) check.
> 
> #### Actions
> ***Beak.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* *(Str/Dex + Prof bonus)* to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1 piercing damage.
>

***Portal.*** You can use the staff to open a portal, as if using the *teleportation circle* spell. You spend one minute using the staff to trace glowing lines on the ground, forming a 10-foot-diameter circle inscribed with sigils relating to a single permanent _teleportation circle_. The user of this staff must know the sigil sequence of the target circle, as normal. After the spell is complete, the glowing lines fade away, and the staff cannot be used to open another portal for 1d8 hours.

The staff contains the knowledge of the sigil sequence related to the entranceway of Karazhan, the Tower of the Guardian of Tirisfal. It will impart this knowledge to one who is attuned to and holding the staff. The wielder of the staff cannot scribe or otherwise impart the knowledge of this sigil sequence to another, and if they lose attunement to the staff this knowledge is likewise lost from their memory. 

***Enhanced Power.*** Atiesh bonds with its user, enhancing the abilities of the bearer. The form of this effect changes based on the class of the wielder, as noted below. 

***Aura.*** When held, Atiesh also causes the bearer to spread an aura, affecting them and their allies within a 10-foot radius. The effects of this aura differ based on class, as mentioned below. If the bearer possesses at least 17 levels, the range of his aura extends to 30 feet.

\pagebreakNum

#### Druid

***Nature's Power.*** When you cast a druid spell that restores hit points while wielding this staff, the spell restores an additional 2 hit points to each creature affected. Additionally, when you shapeshift into a druidic form, your natural attacks retain the +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls provided by the staff.

***Nature's Aura.*** When someone starts their turn in your aura, they gain a single enhancement die. An enhancement die is a d4 that can be rolled and added to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the die, but must decide before using the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. A creature can only have one enhancement die at a time, can only benefit from the use of one once per 10 minutes, and loses their enhancement die 10 minutes after leaving your aura. 

The die increases in size based on your level: a d6 at 5th level, a d8 at 9th level, a d10 at 13th level, and d12 at 17th level. 

#### Mage

***Arcane Power.*** When you cast a mage spell while wielding this staff, you gain a +2 bonus to the spell attack roll and to the saving throw DCs. Additionally, if the spell successfully deals damage, it deals +2 points of that damage type to each creature affected.

***Arcane Aura.*** When someone under the effects of your aura roll a 1 on a damage die for the effects of a spell they cast, they can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if it is another 1. They can do this for a number of dice per spell equal to your proficiency modifier. 

#### Priest

***Holy Power.*** When you cast a priest spell while wielding this staff, you gain a +2 bonus to the spell attack roll and to the saving throw DCs. Additionally, if the spell restores hit points, it restores an additional 2 hit points to each creature affected.

***Holy Aura.*** When someone under the effects of your aura regains lost hit points, they regain an additional amount of hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. 

#### Warlock

***Fel Power.*** When you cast a warlock spell while wielding this staff, you gain a +2 bonus to the spell attack roll and to the saving throw DCs. Additionally, warlock spells that you cast crit on a roll of 19 or 20. If you crit against a target under the effect of your Curse of Agony, the critical hit deals an additional die of damage.

***Fel Aura.*** When someone under the effect of your aura deals magical damage (non-bludgeoning, piecing, or slashing damage), they deal an additional number of points of that damage to each creature equal to your proficiency bonus. 

\columnbreak

### Benediction / Anathema

_Staff, very rare (requires attunement by priest)_

The staff can either take the form of the golden staff Benediction or the silver staff Anathema. Some of its properties vary based on which form it currently takes, while others are shared between forms.

***Universal Abilities.*** The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you have resistance to necrotic damage and you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls. 

The staff can be used as a holy symbol. The gem in the staff shines with an inner light, which can be suppressed or resumed as an action. In its Benediction form, the light is as bright as a torch, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. In its Anathema form, the light is softer and more akin to moonlight, providing bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet.

The staff can be transformed between its Benediction and Anathema forms as an action. Once this ability has been used, it cannot be used again for 1 hour.

The staff has 20 charges, and regains 2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the gem becomes a dull colorless crystal that no longer sheds light while the staff fades to a tarnished silver, and while the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls, it loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regains 1d8 + 2 charges.

The staff can either take the form of the golden staff Benediction or the silver staff Anathema. Some of its properties vary based on which form it currently takes, while others are shared between forms.


<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>

#### Benediction

_Behind every shadow there is the light of hope._

***Benediction.*** The golden Benediction form has the following abilities.
- _Holy Light._ While holding Benediction, spells that you cast that deal radiant damage score a critical hit on a roll of a 19 or 20.
- _Healing Light._ While holding Benediction, whenever you cast a spell that restores hit points to a creature, it restores an additional amount equal to your proficiency bonus.
- _Spells._ While holding this staff, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: cure wounds (1 charge per spell level, up to 4th), lesser restoration (2 charges), or mass cure wounds (5 charges).

\pagebreakNum

#### Anathema

_For every light, there is a shadow._

***Anathema.*** The Anathema form has the following abilities.
- _Shadow Energy._ While holding Anathema, you can expend 1 charge as a bonus action to restore 2 light points.
- _Shadow Power._ While holding Anathema, whenever you deal necrotic damage to a creature, it deals an additional amount equal to your proficiency bonus.
- _Spells_ While holding this staff, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: dark void† (1 charge per spell level, up to 4th), void strike† (2 charges), or negative energy flood†† (5 charges).

† _Dark void_ and _void strike_ are depicted in the Warcraft Hero's Handbook.

†† _Negative energy flood_ is depicted in Xanathar's Guide to Everything.

### Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest

_Staff, legendary (requires attunement by a spellcaster)_

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While you hold it, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls and to spell save DCs.

The staff has 50 charges for the following properties. It regains 4d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 20, the staff regains 1d12 + 1 charges.

***Spell Absorption.*** While holding the staff, you have advantage on saving throws against spells. In addition, you can use your reaction when another creature casts a spell that targets only you. If you do, the staff absorbs the magic of the spell, canceling its effect and gaining a number of charges equal to the absorbed spell's level. However, if doing so would bring the staff's total number of charges above 50, the ability fails and you are affected as normal.

***Wrath of Tarecgosa.*** While holding the staff, you can expend some of the charges to duplicate spells. You can convert the charges held within the staff to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.

Alternatively, you can use the charges to duplicate a spell you have witnessed recently cast. The spell must have been cast within 60 feet of you, you must have witnessed the person casting it, it must have been cast within the last round, it must be of a spell level that you can cast, you must provide any expensive material components needed by the spell, and there must be enough charges in the staff to fuel the spell. The spell does not need to be one that is on your class list or a spell that you can normally cast, as long as it meets these other requirements.

***Tarecgosa's Visage.*** While holding the staff, you can expend four charges to transform into an echo of the power of the blue dragon Tarecgosa. This uses the rules for a druid's shapeshift ability, as noted in the Warcraft Hero's Handbook, and the stats listed in the sidebar below. 

If you are at least level 7, you can instead use the staff to polymorph into a blue drake, as if using the spell. The statistics for a blue drake are depicted in the Manual of Monsters.

Using this ability requires that the one attuned and the spirit housed in the staff to not only not be in conflict, but for there to be a genuine connection between the two. Generally this only occurs when the bearer has accomplished some great deed in regards to magic, or when the interests and goals of the two are in alignment.

***Sentience.*** *Dragonwrath* is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision out to 60 ft., and blindsight out to 10 ft.

The staff can speak, read, and understand Common and Draconic, and can communicate with its bearer telepathically. Its voice is feminine and aristocratic. While you are attuned to it, *Dragonwrath* also understands every language you know.

***Personality.*** Tarecgosa, the blue dragon whose spirit is housed inside *Dragonwrath*, speaks with a slight condescension towards mortal creatures. She does not do so maliciously; she merely believes that mortality prevents one from having perspective necessary to properly understand the nature of magic. When carried by an accomplished magic-user, Tarecgosa gets over her prejudice and becomes genuinely affectionate and appreciative.

*Dragonwrath*'s purpose is that of the blue dragonflight: magic. Acquiring it, researching it, cataloging it. Magic must be regulated, managed, and controlled. But it must also be appreciated and valued and not hoarded. She is content to act mostly as on observer, unless she witnesses some interesting spell or a creature abusing magic in some way.

If the bearer works against the cause of magic, such as selfishly hoarding knowledge and magic items for personal gain, a conflict will occur.

### Fangs of the Father

*Weapon (2 daggers), legendary (requires attunement by a rogue)*

Fangs of the Father is a paired set of daggers. A rogue cannot attune to just one, he must attune to both **Golad, Twilight of Aspects** and **Tiriosh, Nightmare of Ages**, and uses only a single attunement slot for the both of them.

Each is a dagger that provides a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls and if either is on your person you can use your reaction to cast _feather fall_ on yourself. However, the full benefit of these daggers only comes into play if both are used as part of two-weapon fighting.

***Twin Fangs.*** While engaging in two-weapon fighting while wielding *Golad* in one hand and *Tiriosh* in the other, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. You can also add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. You can make this second attack with advantage if you hit with the first dagger as part of the Attack action.

In addition, if a target is hit by both daggers in the same round, it takes an additional 1d4 slashing damage from the second attack and cannot make an attack of opportunity against you for the rest of your turn.

***Shadows of the Destroyer.*** Every time you successfully hit an opponent with either of the daggers, they gain a charge. A charge gained this way is shared between both daggers. The daggers can hold up to 30 charges; any charges in excess of this total are wasted. You can use your action to spend 3 charges to regain a point of energy.

***Fury of the Destroyer.*** You can expend three charges (gained through _shadow of the Destroyer_) as part of your Attack action to make an extra attack with one of your daggers. You can only do this twice per turn: once with your main hand and once with your off hand.

### Rhok'delar, Longbow of the Ancient Keepers

*Weapon (longbow), legendary (requires attunement by a hunter)*

**Rhok'delar** is a weapon with two forms. When it is unstrung, it can be used as a quarterstaff and is known as **Lok'delar** instead. In addition to its other form, it is also paired with an unnamed quiver made of leaves and dragonhide; where the bow goes, the quiver follows. The weapon is alive, and is known to occasionally glow a soft green or sprout blossoms and vines, though these do not interfere in the use of the weapon. 

***Transform.*** As an action, you can unstring the bow and use it as a quarterstaff. In this form, it is known as Lok'delar, Stave of the Ancient Keepers. You can restring it as an action, returning it to the form of a longbow.

***Weapon of the Ancients.*** The weapon provides a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls, and provides advantage on attacks versus fiends made using this weapon. While carrying it, you have resistance to poison damage and advantage on saving throws versus being poisoned and the poisoned condition. When you score a critical hit with an attack from this weapon, you can roll an additional die equal to the weapon's damage and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.

***Ancient Sinew Wrapped Lamina.*** The quiver can hold more arrows than it seems like it normally could; it can contain up to 60 arrows in an extradimensional space. The quiver also has a compartment on its side that can easily hold Rhok'delar, whether strung or unstrung. It also extends a protective quality over the arrows it holds. Arrows stored in the quiver cannot be broken, unless they enter an antimagic field. This effect lasts for 1 round after leaving the quiver.

### Shadowmourne

*Weapon (greataxe), legendary (requires attunement by a death knight)*

Shadowmourne provides a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls, as well as the following abilities. A death knight treats Shadowmourne as his rune weapon for as long as he is attuned to it.

***Saronite Weapon.*** Shadowmourne is made out of saronite, the crystallized blood of the Old God Yogg-Saron. As such, it has certain effects, as noted below. 
- It casts a blue-green light as a candle. This effect cannot be suppressed.
- It is resistant to all forms of damage, except for acid damage. It is immune to radiant damage.
- When used as part of an attack that deals radiant damage, it reacts violently. The spell or ability automatically fails (with the action wasted), the person activating the ability takes an amount of radiant damage equal to the number of dice in the original effect, and they must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or be knocked prone.
- It is particularly good at breaking objects. Whenever Shadowmourne hits an object, the hit is a critical hit.
- Shadowmourne deals damage to the soul as well as the body. It ignores slashing damage resistance.
 
***Curse of Yogg-Saron.*** The user of Shadowmourne is subject to the Curse of Yogg-Saron, as noted in the sidebar on the next page. 
***Soul Fragments.*** Shadowmourne shaves off and devours pieces of souls, both those it cuts and those of the wielder if they are not careful. It stores these pieces inside itself as charges, which can be used to power its other abilities. Shadowmourne gains a charge whenever it is used to deal a critical hit or if a creature within 5 feet is reduced to 0 hit points. It can hold a maximum of 13 charges. Any charges in excess of this total are lost and attempting to use an ability when no charges remain causes the bearer to take 2d6 points of damage instead.

***Power of Blood, Frost, and the Unholy.*** While wielding Shadowmourne, for every 4 charges currently stored in it, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and to spell save DCs, to a maximum of +3.

***Chaos Bane.*** By expending charges, you can unleash a flood of negative energy. All other creatures within 15 feet of you take 2d6 necrotic damage. For each charge beyond the first that you expend, the damage increases by 2d6 and the range increases by 5 feet. 

You are bolstered by this effect, gaining advantage on all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks for a number of rounds equal to the number of charges expended.

\pagebreakNum

***Devour Soul.*** Whenever you use it to reduce a creature to 0 hit points, the sword slays the creature devours its soul, unless it is a construct or an undead. A creature whose soul has been devoured by Shadowmourne can be restored to life only by a *wish* spell.

> ### Curse of Yogg-Saron
> 
> Items made of saronite whisper in the minds of those that carry them, slowly driving them insane. Unless an item is sealed in a lead-lined box or kept at a distance, those who spend at least 1 minute carrying, wearing, or wielding the item must make a DC 15 Charisma save at the end of their next long rest. Failure causes 1 point of Charisma damage, which lasts until removed by magic such as _greater restoration_. 
>
> If your Charisma is reduced to 0 as a result of this damage, you become permanently insane, as you seek out the Master who whispers in your mind. Once you reach this state, nothing less than a _wish_ can cure your mind.
>
> Undead and Death Knights have shown a remarkable resistance to this effect and can use the item normally without having to make Charisma saves, though the whispers remain.

### Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros

_Weapon (maul), legendary (requires attunement)_

**Sulfuras** is a maul that is massive even for its type. It weighs 20 lbs and deals 2d8 points of bludgeoning damage when it hits. 

***Hammer of the Firelord.*** The spiked head of this maul constantly glows red with a heat that cannot be suppressed. It sheds bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. When you successfully hit a creature with this weapon, it takes an additional 2d6 points of fire damage. When a creature hits you with a melee attack, they take 5 points of fire damage.

When attuned to and holding Sulfuras, you have fire resistance. Those who are not attuned to the weapon who attempt to touch it take 1 point of fire damage every round they do so. Any unattended flammable object that touches the head of the hammer is ignited.

***Eye of Sulfuras.*** As an action, you can swing Sulfuras and launch an orb of fire, making a ranged attack against a creature you can see within 60 feet. The attack modifier is the same as if you were making a melee attack, and the attack deals 2d6 fire damage on a hit and potentially setting them aflame. The creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity save at the beginning of their next turn and at the beginning of each of their turns thereafter, taking 1d4 points of fire damage on a failure. This lasts for 1 minute, until they make a successful save, or until they take an action to extinguish the flames.

### Thori'dal, the Star's Fury

_Weapon (longbow), legendary (requires attunement)_

Attacks made with this weapon gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

***Endless Ammunition.*** By pulling back the string of this bow when no ammunition is loaded, a magical arrow is produced, nocked and ready to fire. Once removed from the string, either by launching the arrow in an attack or by any other means, the arrow disappears at the end of the round.

***Rapid Fire.*** Thori'dal's ability to generate ammunition allows more arrows to be fired in the same amount of time. On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to make two attacks with this longbow. These extra attacks must only use the magical arrows provided by the *endless ammunition* ability. 

***Defensive Weapon.*** Thori'dal has a broad metal hand cover worked into the weapon. This helps provide some level of defense, granting a +1 bonus to AC as if using a buckler. This ability does not require for the wielder to be proficient in shields, nor are they penalized if they lack this proficiency.

### Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker

*Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement)*

When attuned to this weapon, you have resistance to lightning and thunder damage. Attacks made with this weapon gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls.  When you hit a creature with this weapon, your attacks deal an additional 1d6 lightning damage. 

Whenever your attack roll comes up as 16 or higher on the d20, two additional effects occur. First, a bolt of lightning leaps from the initial target and attacks the nearest enemy to the initial target within 30 feet. Use the same attack roll and modifier as the initial attack. If the attack is a hit, then the bolt continues to the nearest enemy target within 30 feet. It continues until the first miss or until up to 5 targets are hit by this bolt. No creature can be hit more than once by this effect.

Upon being hit by this bolt, the first creature takes 1d4 lightning damage and gains vulnerability to lightning damage for 1 round. This damage increases for each successive strike, increasing to 1d6 for the second target, 1d8 for the third, 1d10 for the fourth, and 1d12 for the fifth. When this effect occurs, a loud crack of thunder can be heard up to 300 feet away.

Additionally, the initial target is wreathed in a cyclone of imprisoning wind, hampering their attacks. They suffer a -2 penalty to attack and damage rolls.

### Twin Blades of Azzinoth

*Weapons (warglaives), legendary (requires attunement by a demon hunter)*

When you attune to these weapons, you must attune to both at the same time. They only take up a single attunement slot. Attacks with these weapons have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls. When attacking a fiend, this bonus increases to +4.

When you attack and roll a natural 20 on the attack roll, the attack deals an extra 2d6 slashing damage. This increases to 4d6 if the creature is a fiend. If a fiend has 25 hit points or less after taking this damage, it is destroyed. 

While attuned to these weapons, you can call them to hand as a bonus action as long as they are on the same plane. You can call one or both as part of the same bonus action.

### Aldrachi Warblades
*Warglaives, heirloom (requires attunement)*

The Aldrachi Warblades are a paired set of warglaives. You cannot attune to just one--you must attune to both at the same time. When you do, you use only a single attunement slot for the both of them.

This heirloom is associated with Demon Hunters who bear the Mark of Vengeance.

The heirloom provides the following benefits in their dormant state:
___
- ***Aldrachi Design.*** Each warblade provides a +1 bonus to Armor Class.
- ***Superior Warglaive.*** When you throw one of the warglaives, it returns to you even if you roll a natural 1.
___
While in an awakened state, the heirloom provides the following benefits:
___
- ***Honed Warblades.*** You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with these weapons.
- ***Soul Carver.*** You can spend 1 fel point to ignite the warblades, causing them to deal an additional 1d4 fire damage on hits for 1 minute. When you damage a creature while this effect is active, it generates a *soul fragment*. You can not have more *soul fragments* than your demon hunter level and you lose all unspent fragments after 1 hour.
- ***Devour Souls.*** You can consume a *soul fragment* at the beginning of your turn. When you do, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier. If you use this ability while under the effects of metamorphosis, these temporary hit points stack with themselves up to a limit of your demon hunter level.
___
While in the invigorated state, the heirloom provides the following abilities:
___
- ***Honed Warblades.*** The bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2.
- ***Defensive Spikes.*** You can spend 1 fel point as a reaction to gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage until the end of your next turn.
- ***Siphon Power.*** You can consume a *soul fragment* to have advantage on your next attack roll.
___
While the heirloom is in the empowered state, it provides the following abilities:
___
- ***Honed Warblades.*** The bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3.
- ***Aura of Pain.*** When you use Immolation Aura, each creature damaged by it is affected by your Torment ability. Torment applied this way does not end early if you affect another creature with Torment or with Aura of Pain.
- ***Embrace the Pain.*** When you take damage from Immolation Aura, you can gain a bonus on your next successful damage roll equal to the amount of damage taken. 
___
While the heirloom is in an unshackled state, it provides the following abilities:
___
- ***Demonic Flames.*** Fire damage dealt by your demon hunter abilities or by these weapons ignores fire damage resistance and treats fire damage immunity as resistance instead.
- ***Fiery Demise.*** When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can unleash a blast of flame that deals fire damage equal to your demon hunter level to each creature in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on you.
- ***Soulgorger.*** When you use the *devour souls* ability, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice your Intelligence modifier instead.
___
When the heirloom reaches the exalted state, it provides the following abilities:
___
- ***Artifact.*** The weapon is considered an artifact and has 2 random minor beneficial properties and 2 random major beneficial properties.
- ***Charred Warblades.*** When you deal fire damage with your *soul carver* ability, you heal a number of hit points equal to the amount dealt.
- ***Painbringer.*** When you use metamorphosis, you gain resistance to all damage.
