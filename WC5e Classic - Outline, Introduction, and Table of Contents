Battle Angler
You've mastered the eccentric art of using a fishing rod in battle. You gain the following benefits:

Fishing rods are considered a martial weapon with which you are proficient in. You double the normal and long range of a fishing rod you are wielding.
Catch and Release. You can chose whether or not a creature becomes tethered when you hit it with a fishing rod. If you decide a creature isn't tethered, you can immediately reel the rod in (no action required).
Fast Reeling. You can attempt to reel in a creature tethered with a spooled weapon as a bonus action.
Large Catch. You can reel in tethered creatures of up to one size larger than you would be able to normally.
Hooked. You can use your own DC in place of a weapon's DC to grant or end the tethered condition. This DC is calculated as 8 + your proficiency bonus + your choice of Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom, or Intelligence modifier.

Battle Fishing Rod (5e Equipment)
Jump to navigationJump to search
Weapon (rapier, saber, broadsword, longsword, warhammer, greatsword, or war pick), uncommon

This fishing rod has been augmented with magic and integrated with a weapon, allowing it to be used effectively in battle. While you wield this fishing rod, you can choose to wield it either as the integrated weapon or to use it as a fishing rod.

Serrated Hook. The battle fishing rod is equipped with a magic hook. It deals 1d4 piercing damage on a hit, and the DC for removing the battle fishing rod's hook from a tethered creature is 15 instead of 10. On your turn while you hold the rod (no action required), you can cause the hook to release from the creature, untethering it.

Durable Line. The line of the battle fishing rod is reinforced with magic. It can only be broken by dealing 10 slashing damage to it (AC 20) or by the tethered creature rolling a 30 on the contested Strength (Athletics) check. Additionally, the strengthened line means the rod can be used to reel in a creature of up to Large size.


Spooled (5e Variant Rule)
Jump to navigationJump to search
Spooled
Some weapons have a line of flexible material (such as string, rope, or chain) attached, indicated by a distance in feet in parentheses.

If you make a ranged attack with a spooled weapon against a target within this distance, you can hold onto the line. As long as you are holding onto the line, you can use your object interaction (unless specified otherwise by the weapon) to reel the weapon back in and retrieve it. Until you retrieve it, you can’t make another attack with that weapon.
