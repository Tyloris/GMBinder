\pagebreakNum

### Pact Magic
*1st-level witch doctor feature*
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.

#### Cantrips
You know two cantrips of your choice from the witch doctor spell list. You learn additional witch doctor cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Witch Doctor table.

#### Mana

The Witch Doctor table shows how much mana you have to cast your witch doctor spells of 1st level and higher. The table also shows what the level spells you can cast. To cast one of your witch doctor spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend mana, as noted in the spell's description and the Mana Cost table found below. You regain all expended mana gained from this class when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *charm person* and have a spell level of 2nd, you can use mana to cast it as either a 1st-level or 2nd-level spell.

##### Mana Cost
Spell Level | Mana Cost | Spell Level | Mana Cost
:------:|:-:|:---:|:-:
Cantrip | — | 5th | 7
1st     | 2 | 6th | 9
2nd     | 3 | 7th | 10
3rd     | 5 | 8th | 11
4th     | 6 | 9th | 13

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the witch doctor spell list.

The Spells Known column of the witch doctor table shows when you learn more witch doctor spells of your choice of 1st level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new witch doctor spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the witch doctor spells you know and replace it with another spell from the witch doctor spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your witch doctor spells, so you use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a witch doctor spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<div style="text-align: center">

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br/> your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br/> your Wisdom modifier
</div>

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an voodoo fetish as a spellcasting focus for your witch doctor spells.

### Subclass
*1st-level witch doctor feature*
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

#### Subclass Spells
Each Subclass has a list of Subclass Spells that you learn at the Warlock levels noted in your Subclass description. These spells count as Witch Doctor spells for you, but they do not count against your total number of Spells Known.

#### Subclass Ideas
Name | Description
-----|----------
Hexxer      | 
Spirit Master?| Necromancy specialist
Tiki Lord   | Create animated mask
Zombies     | Zombies

### Invocations
*2nd-level witch doctor feature*
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, pieces of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability or other lessons. You gain one invocation of your choice, such as Pact of the Tome. Invocations are described in the "Eldritch Invocation Options" section later in this class's description.

**Prerequisites.** If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For example, if an invocation requires you to be a level 5+ Warlock, you can select the invocation once you reach Warlock level 5.

**Replacing and Gaining Invocations.** Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one for which you qualify. You can't replace an invocation if it's a prerequisite for another invocation that you have.

When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations column of the Warlock Features table.

You can't pick the same invocation more than once unless its description says otherwise.

### Magic Recharge
*2nd-level witch doctor feature*
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

Once per long rest, you can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute to regain use of some of your mana. You regain half of the mana provided by this class (round up). For example, if you are a 11th level witch doctor, you would regain 11 mana.

### Ability Score Improvement
*4th-level witch doctor feature*
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Witch Doctor levels 8, 12, and 16.

### Epic Boon
*19th-level witch doctor feature*
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended.

\pagebreak

### Capstone
*20th-level witch doctor feature*
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

When you use your Magic Recharge feature, you regain all expended Pact Magic slots or Mana provided by this class.


Possession
At the 11th level, the Old God bestows upon you another gift—the gift of Possession. You can absorb the spirit of another long-dead Witch Doctor, gaining the permanent ability to channel that spirit to tap into its power. Choose a 6th-level spell from the Witch Doctor spell list as your Possession spell. You can call upon that spirit to Possess you for a short time, enabling you to cast that spell without expending a spell slot.

At higher levels, you can absorb additional and more powerful spirits, allowing you to gain more Possession spells: one 7th-level spell at the 13th level, one 8th-level spell at the 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at the 17th level. Possession resets when you finish a short or long rest.

Voodoo Guru
At the 20th level, the Old God bestows upon you the title of “Voodoo Guru”, and creates a permanent and direct link between itself and the Witch Doctor. Once per long rest, you can call upon a favor of the Old God to restore all expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature.


## Witch Doctor Secrets
#### Armor of Shadows
Whenever you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield, your Armor Class is 13 + your Wisdom modifier.

#### Aspect of the Moon
You no longer need to sleep and cannot be forced to sleep by any means. To gain the benefits of a long rest, you can spend all 8 hours doing light activity, such as keeping watch.

#### Beguiling Influence
You have become infused with an otherworldly charm and presence. You gain proficiency in two of the following skills: Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion.

Whenever you make an ability check with the skills from this Invocation, you can add your Wisdom modifier to your roll in place of the normal ability score associated with the skill.

#### Blood Scent

#### Gaze of Two Minds
You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature’s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.

#### Gift of Gral
You manifest aquatic features. You can breathe underwater, and you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

At 5th level, you learn the water breathing spell, and you can cast it once per long rest without expending a spell slot.

#### Homunculus Servant
You can craft a loyal servant over the course of 10 minutes, using 100 gp worth of materials (such as bundles of herbs, fine clay, or a carved stone figurine) as well as 1 pint of your blood. You determine its appearance, but this has no effect on its abilities. It is friendly to you, and it obeys your orders. It uses the Homunculus Servant stat block on this page, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.

You can only have one homunculus servant at a time; if you create another, the previous one turns to ash. If your homunculus servant dies, you can spend 2 mana and 1 minute repairing it, restoring it to life with its maximum hit points. If you die, it turns to ash after 1 minute.

In combat, your Homunculus acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but it only takes the Dodge action on its turn unless you use your bonus action to order it to take an action in its stat block, or another action. If you are incapacitated, your Homunculus can act on its own and will defend its master to the best of its abilities.

#### Iron Will
You have Advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain Concentration.

#### Loa's Embrace
Whenever you regain hit points, you can treat any die rolled as its maximum value.

\pagebreakNum

#### Magic Sight
As an action you can awaken your senses to see the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. For 10 minutes, you can see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in that radius that bears magic, instantly learning its school of magic, if any. This sight is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. You must concentrate on this sense as if you were concentrating on a spell.

#### Mask of Many Faces
Strange and sinister magics have made your form fluid. As an action, you can change your physical appearance and voice to match that of a creature that you have seen before, so long as the new appearance has the same arrangement of limbs. You determine the specifics, including your race, coloration, sex, height, weight, and hair length, but you cannot change sizes. Transforming does not affect your clothing or game statistics.

Misty Visions
As an action, you shape otherworldly shadow into an illusory image of an object, creature, or a visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube in a spot you can see within 60 feet of. This image is purely visual; it cannot be accompanied by sound, smell, or other effects. It lasts for 10 minutes.

As an action, you can cause this illusory image to move to another spot within 60 feet. When you do so, you can choose for it to move in a way that appears natural for the image.

A creature that succeeds on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your Spell save DC sees through the illusion.

Conjuring a second illusion dispels any previous illusions.

Sylvan Speech
You learn to speak Sylvan, and while speaking in Sylvan you can comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, they can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived in the past day.

At 7th level, you can speak in Sylvan to communicate with plants as if you were under the effects of speak with plants.

#### Potion Master
When crafting common or uncommon magical potions, it takes one quarter of the time and costs half as much in material components. 

This applies to higher rarity potions as you increase in witch doctor level: rare potions at 5th level, epic potions at 11th level, and legendary potions at 17th level.

#### Ultravision
You can see normally in Dim Light and Darkness—both magical and nonmagical—within 120 feet of yourself.

#### Cloak of Decay
*Prerequisites: 3rd level*
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

As a bonus action, you conjure (or dispel) a swarm of ghostly flies that surround you in a 5-foot radius. Creatures of your choice that start their turn in this area take piercing damage equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 0).

The flies grant you advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks, but disadvantage on all other Charisma checks.

#### Voodoo Vigor
*Prerequisite: 3rd level*
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You can cast *false life* on yourself without spending mana. You cast this at a level equal to your proficiency bonus. When you cast the spell with this feature, you don't roll the die for the Temporary Hit Points; you automatically get the highest number on the die.

#### One with Shadows
*Prerequisite: 5th level*
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

While you're in an area of Dim Light or Darkness, you can cast *invisibility* on yourself without spending mana.

#### Powerful Mojo
*Prerequisite: 5th level*
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

Your vitality increases dramatically, granting you the following:
- The Hit Dice provided by this class increase by one size (d6 becomes d8, d8 becomes d10, etc.)
- Your hit point maximum increases by 1 plus 1 per witch doctor level. For example, a 5th-level witch doctor would thus gain 6 additional hit points.

You can select this secret up to three times.

#### Spirit Blade
*Prerequisite: 5th level*

As a bonus action, you can conjure a spirit in the form of a weapon in your empty hand. Each time you do, it takes the form of a melee weapon of your choice with these special benefits:
- You can use your Wisdom modifier, in place of your Strength or Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls with this weapon.
- You are proficient with this weapon if you weren't already.
- You can cause the weapon to deal Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage in place of its normal damage type.
- You can use it as a spellcasting focus for your witch doctor spells.

The Spirit Blade disappears if it is more than 5 feet from you for 1 minute, if you conjure another Spirit Blade, if you dismiss your Spirit Blade (no action required), or if you die.

You can bond a magic melee weapon as an Spirit Blade by performing a 1-hour ritual. You can use a bonus action to shunt it to an extradimensional space, or conjure it. Bonding a second weapon ends the bond for any previous weapons.

#### The Dead Walk
*Prerequisite: 5th level*

You can cast *animate dead* once without expending mana. You cast this at a level equal to your proficiency bonus. Once you do so, you can't cast it in this way again until you finish a long rest.

#### Thirsting Blade
*Prerequisites: Level 5+ Warlock, Spirit Blade*
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You gain the Extra Attack feature for your Spirit Blade only. With that feature, you can attack twice with the weapon instead of once when you take the Attack action on your turn.

\pagebreakNum

Additionally, if you use your action to cast a Witch Doctor spell, you can make one Spirit Blade attack as a bonus action.

#### Ascendant Step
*Prerequisite: 7th level*
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

As a bonus action, you can grant yourself a temporary flying speed equal to your walking speed, which lasts until the end of your current turn, but you cannot hover. If you end your turn and are not secure then you fall to the ground.

#### Whispers of the Grave
*Prerequisite: 7th level*
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You learn the *speak with dead* spell and can cast it at will without expending mana.

#### Witch Sight
*Prerequisite: 9th level*

Your eyes glow with an unnatural pale green light. You have Truesight out to a radius of 10 feet while you are conscious.

At 15th level the radius of your Truesight becomes 30 feet.

#### Lifedrinker
*Prerequisites: 11th level, Spirit Blade*
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

Once per turn when you hit a creature with your spirit blade, you can deal an extra 1d6 Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage (your choice) to the creature, and you can expend one of your Hit Point Dice to roll it and regain a number of Hit Points equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 Hit Point).

#### Minor Possession
*Prerequisites: 11th level*
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You can absorb the spirit of another long-dead Witch Doctor, gaining the permanent ability to channel that spirit to tap into its power. Choose a 6th-level spell from the Witch Doctor spell list as your Possession spell. You can call upon that spirit to Possess you for a short time, enabling you to cast that spell without spending mana. Once you use this spell, you must complete a long rest before you can cast do so again.

#### Devouring Blade
*Prerequisites: 12th level, Thirsting Blade*
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

The Extra Attack of your Thirsting Blade secret confers two extra attacks rather than one.

#### Greater Possesion
*Prerequisites: 13th level*
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

Until the bond ends, you have proficiency with the weapon, and you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus.

Whenever you attack with the bonded weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity; and you can cause the weapon to deal Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage or its normal damage type.

### Spell Descriptions

#### Baleful Polymorph (Hex)
*5th-level Transmutation*
___
- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Permanent
---
You attempt to transform a creature that you can see within range into a Beast. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or shape-shift into Beast form for the duration. If the new form would prove fatal to the creature (for example, if you polymorphed a landbound target into a fish, or an airborne target into a toad), the subject has advantage on the save.

The new form can be any Beast you choose that has a Challenge Rating of 0, such as a frog or sheep. The target's game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen Beast, but the target retains its alignment, personality, creature type, Hit Points, and Hit Point Dice. The target is limited in the actions it can perform by the anatomy of its new form, and it can't speak or cast spells. The target's gear falls to the ground at its feet, even if they could be worn or carried by the new form.

The target is allowed an additional saving throw when it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 24 hours, ending the spell on a success. After the target fails three of these saves, the spell becomes permanent and the target's game statistics are fully replaced by the chosen form.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the target gets one less additional saving throw before the spell becomes permanent. 

For example, if you cast this spell at 6th level, the target would be permanently polymorphed after failing two additional saves, and if you cast it at 8th level or higher, the target will be permanently transformed if it fails its initial save.

#### Berserk Rage
*2nd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 ft.
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You attempt to drive a willing creature you can see into a rage for the duration. While in a rage, the target gains the following:
- They have advantage on Concentration and Strength checks and on Strength saving throws.
- They have advantage on melee and thrown weapon attack rolls.
- When they make a melee or weapon attack using Strength, they deal an additional 1d4 damage.
- They have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
- They cannot cast spells or concentrate on them.

However, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw or become berserk (as the condition) for the duration. Once a creature has become berserk, ending your concentration does not end the spell's effects on them.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature per spell slot above 2nd level.

\pagebreakNum

# Appendix A: Conditions

### Berserk
A berserk creature is driven mad with blind rage, most commonly due to the effects of a drug, a curse, or a creature associated with madness. Many things may cause a creature to become berserk, but it is always specified by the feature.
#### Effects
A creature's mind is completely maddened after going berserk, making them gain the following while under the condition:
- The berserk creature must use its action each round to attack the creature nearest to it. If it can make extra attacks as part of the Attack action, it uses those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after it fells its current target. If it has multiple possible targets, it attacks one at random.
- If it can use its reaction and/or bonus action to deal damage directly to a creature, it must do so.
- When a non-hostile creature moves out of a berserk creature's reach, it provokes an opportunity attack.
- It has disadvantage on Wisdom ability checks and saving throws and automatically fails Intelligence ability checks and saving throws.
- It can't cast or concentrate on spells.
- It is immune to the charmed and frightened conditions.
#### Removal
- The condition ends if the berserk creature starts its turn with no creatures within 60 feet of it that it can see or hear.
- A *calm emotions* spell, or any other feature that suppresses or removes the charmed condition, likewise affects a berserk creature.
#### Resistances and Vulnerabilities
- Creatures that have advantage against the charmed condition or have resistance to psychic damage have advantage against the berserk condition.
- Creatures that are immune to psychic damage or the charmed condition are also immune to the berserk condition.

\columnbreak

### Bloodlusted
A creature affected with bloodlust has worked itself into a frenzied state, most likely due to partaking too deep into an inner sadistic nature, the effects of a drug or curse, or high levels of stress. All that matters is that they wish to destroy a single target, and won't stop until they do.
#### Cause
There are many things that may lead a creature to becoming bloodlusted. This condition is generally caused by a feature that messes with the creature's mind, although always specified in said feature. However, differing from the berserk condition a player may choose to enter the bloodlust condition at will for roleplaying purposes. A creature cannot be bloodlusted towards more than one creature at once.
#### Effects
A creature's mind is completely maddened after going berserk, making them gain the following while under the condition:
- A bloodlusted creature must use its whole turn each round to harm the creature that it currently is bloodlusted towards. Even if it would not be beneficial to harm the creature such as by provoking an opportunity attack from a creature, the bloodlusted creature would do it.
- A bloodlusted creature has disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma ability checks and saving throws.
- A bloodlusted creature automatically fails Intelligence ability checks and saving throws, and can't cast or concentrate on spells.
- A bloodlusted creature is immune to the charmed and frightened conditions, and they will instantly lose these conditions in case they receive the bloodlusted condition.
#### Removal
- The condition ends if the creature which caused the condition is killed.
- The conditions ends if the bloodlusted creature starts its turn with the creature it is bloodlusted towards out of its sight or hearing range.
- The condition ends if the calm emotions spell is cast or any other feature which suppresses or removes the charmed condition can also cure the bloodlusted condition in addition to its usual effects.
#### Resistances and Vulnerabilities
- Creatures that have advantage against the charmed condition or have resistance to psychic damage have advantage against the bloodlusted condition.
- Creatures that are immune to psychic damage or the charmed condition are also immune to the bloodlusted condition.
