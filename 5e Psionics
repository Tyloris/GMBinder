## Psionic Magic
### Psionic Energy
Certain racial traits, class features, or other abilities provide characters with a wellspring of psionic energy known as Psionic Energy dice that can be used to fuel psychic powers.

***Psionic Energy Dice.*** The number of Psionic Energy dice you have, and their size, depends on their source. Multiple sources of Psionic Energy dice do not stack: Use only the highest die size and number of dice. Some powers expend the Psionic Energy dice they use, and you can't use a power if it requires you to use a die when your dice are all expended.

You regain all your expended Psionic Energy dice when you finish a long rest. In addition, as a bonus action, you can regain one expended Psionic Energy die, but you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Dice Size.*** Unless otherwise stated, your Psionic Energy dice are d6s. The size of these dice may increase with certain feats or if you have levels in a class that provides Psionic Energy dice, such as the Psi Warrior fighter subclass or the Soulknife rogue subclass. 

***Multiclassing.*** If you have levels in multiple classes with Psionic Energy dice, add those levels together for the purposes of determining the size of those dice.

### Psionic Magic
***Psionic Components.*** Psionic magic, like traditional magic spells such as those cast by a cleric or wizard, has physical requirements known as spell components: verbal, somatic, and material components. Unlike traditional spells, these components are used as mnemonic tools to help reduce the immense mental burden of casting psionic magic.

A verbal component may not be a prayer to a god or an arcane set of sounds whose specific pitch and resonance conjure a spell, but may instead be a nursery rhyme that brings forth memories of childhood slumber to cause a group of goblins to fall asleep. A somatic component may not be an intricate set of movements, but instead could be gestures with subconscious associations, such as "a raised arm warding off a blow to help bring forth a magical shield.

Similarly, certain material components may have symbolic associations that help form a psionic spell. As an example, the phrase *a copper penny for your thoughts* is common enough that the use of a copper piece can help form the mindset needed to cast the *detect thoughts* spell. Alternatively, the energy from the destruction of a consumed component can help provide a boost to bring forth more powerful magic.

***Ignoring Components.*** Since these components are merely mnemonic aids, a user of psionic magic can cast spells without providing one or more of them. However, doing so is difficult and mentally straining. The caster must make an ability check using their spellcasting modifier against a DC of 10 + the spell's level. On a failure, the spell fails and the spell slot is wasted. This ability does not allow a caster to ignore the requirement of material components with a cost.

Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

***Collective Experience.*** You can actively tap into the Dromite hive-mind to gain an edge in situations that you are not personally experienced in. As a bonus action, you tap into the hive-mind and may roll one Psionic Energy die to any ability check in which you do not already have proficiency. 

You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

***Natural Armor.*** You have a hardened layer of skin, similar to an exoskeleton. When you aren’t wearing armor, your base AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier.

***Find the Weak Spot.*** When you make an attack roll against a construct or object, you can expend a Psionic Energy die and add the number rolled to the total.


#### Glimmer Caste
Rarely resting in their pursuit of life’s tasks, the Glimmer Caste always seems to move at high speed.

As such they’re seen in many positions across Dromite hive-cities.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 1.

***Lightning Affinity.*** You have resistance to lightning damage and deal lightning damage with your energy beam.

***Speed Burst.*** When you move on your turn in combat, you can double your speed until the end of the turn. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you move 0 feet on one of your turns, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die.

#### Ice Caste
Slow to make decisions but often right. The analytical Ice Caste are often the scholars and artisans of a Dromite hive-city.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 1.

***Calculating Mind.*** If you fail an Intelligence ability check, you can roll one Psionic Energy die and add the number rolled to the check, potentially turning failure into success. You expend the die only if the roll succeeds.

## Elans
### Elan Traits
Your elan character has the following traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Like humans, elans have a widely varied nature. Increase one ability score by 2 and increase a different one by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.

***Creature Type.*** You are a Humanoid.

***Age.*** Elans usually start their new life as a young adult in their early twenties. An elan has no theoretical maximum lifespan, potentially living for thousands of years.

***Alignment.*** Elans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.

***Size.*** Elans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Aberrant Mind.*** Although human in appearance, elans have rather alien minds. You count as an aberration instead of humanoid for the purposes of spell and effects that cause the charmed, frightened, or paralyzed conditions.

***Meditation.*** Elans don't need to sleep. Instead, you meditate in a deep trance for 4 hours a day. While in this trance, you concentrate on suffusing your body with psionic energy, healing the hurts of the day, and restoring animation and resiliency to your tissues. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

***Naturally Psionic.*** Elans are naturally psionic creatures. You have a number of Psionic Energy dice equal to your proficiency bonus, each of which are a d6.

***Repletion.*** You can take an action to expend a Psionic Energy die, channeling your psionic power to nourish yourself for the next 24 hours, as if you consumed sufficient food and water for a day.

***Resilience.*** When you take damage, you can use your reaction to expend one Psionic Energy die and roll it. Add your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier to the number rolled, and reduce the damage by that total. Choose which ability score to use when you select this race.

***Resistance.*** If you fail a saving throw, you can roll one Psionic Energy die and add the number rolled to the save, potentially turning failure into success. You expend the die only if the roll succeeds.

***Telepathy.*** You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Your telepathic utterances are in a language you know, and the creature understands you only if it knows that language. Your communication doesn't give the creature the ability to respond to you telepathically.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Elans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.

## Thri-Kreen
#### Thri-kreen Traits
***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity increases by 2. Your Strength increases by 1.

***Creature Type.*** You are a Monstrosity.

***Age.*** Thri-kreen age and reach adulthood twice as fast as humans, rarely living longer than thirty years.

***Alignment.*** Thri-kreen have virtually no social structure other than the clutches they form with their closest allies. The notion of sophisticated rules for social behavior is foreign to them. They are almost always chaotic in alignment, and often neutral with respect to good and evil.

***Size.*** Thri-kreen are typically six to seven feet tall and weigh about 200 pounds. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your walking speed is 40 feet.

***Desert Carapace.*** While you aren’t wearing armor, your carapace gives you a base Armor Class of 13 + your Dexterity modifier and advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in a desert. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield’s benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor. 

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of yourself as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

***Desert Acclimated.*** You are acclimated to extreme heat environments.

***Natural Weapons.*** Your mandibles and each of your four claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, the strike deals 1d4 + your Strength modifier piercing damage (with your bite) or slashing damage (with your claws), instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

***Poisonous Bite.*** Starting at Xth level, when hit with your bite attack, you can choose to inject poison. The target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, the creature is paralyzed for 1 minute. The creature can attempt another saving throw at the beginning of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

***Non-Humanoid Shape.*** Due to their six-limbed forms, thri-kreen cannot easily wear armor designed for four-limbed creatures. Armor can be converted to fit a thri-kreen by spending an additional 50% of its cost.

***Secondary Arms.*** You have two slightly smaller secondary arms below your primary pair of arms. The secondary arms can manipulate an object, open or close a door or container, pick up or set down a Tiny object, or wield a weapon that has the light property.

***Sleepless.*** You do not require sleep and magic can't put you to sleep. You can choose to remain conscious during a long rest, though you must still refrain from strenuous activity to gain the benefit of the rest.

***Standing Leap.*** Your long jump is up to 40 feet and your high jump is up to 20 feet, with or without a running start.

***Thri-Kreen Weapon Training.*** You have proficiency with the dart, halberd, glaive, and pike.

***Naturally Psionic.*** Thri-Kreen naturally have a Psionic Talent die, the starting size of which is a d6. See Psionic Talent on page 1 for the basic rules on Psionic Talent dice. You can use your Psionic Talent die in the following ways:
___
- ***Thri-Kreen Telepathy.*** As long as your Psionic Talent die is available, you can speak telepathically to any creature you can see within 120 feet of you. Your telepathic utterances are in a language you know, and the creature understands you only if it knows that language. Your communication doesn’t give the creature the ability to respond to you telepathically.
- ***Chameleon Carapace.*** As an action, you can change the color of your carapace to match the color and texture of your surroundings, giving you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in those surroundings when not wearing armor. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest or use this action again. When you take this action, your Psionic Talent die decreases by one die size.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Kreen. Kreen is a language made by the clacking of mandibles and waving of antannae, a method of communication difficult to interpret and impossible to duplicate by other creatures. You can read and write Common, but cannot speak it (or any other language) without the usage of your telepathy.

- **Soulknife.** As long as your Psionic Talent die is available, you can create a shimmering blade of psychic energy. Whenever you take the Attack action, you can manifest a psychic dagger from your free hand and make the attack with that blade. It can deal either piercing or psychic damage on a hit (your choice). The blade vanishes immediately after it hits or misses its target, and it leaves no mark on its target if it deals psychic damage.
- This movement speed boost increases by 10 feet when you reach 5th level (+20 feet), 11th level (+30 feet), and 17th level (+40 feet).

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Xeph.
