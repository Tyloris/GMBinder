## Warrior
*Now, watch them attack me. Pitiful! Do they think to take vengeance for their fallen? Do they come to challenge ME? I, who have won a hundred wars? I, who stood alone against thousands and still shouted for my enemies to come? No, these saurok will crumple before me like <br> paper before the flame!*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Skeer the Bloodseeker* <span style="margin-left:90px"></span></div>

A human in clanging plate armor holds her 
<br> shield high before her as she charges toward the 
<br> massed kobolds. A night elf behind her, clad in 
<br> studded leather armor, peppers the kobolds with 
<br> arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The dwarf nearby shouts orders, helping
the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.

An orc in chainmail interposes his shield between the ogre's club and his companion in a swift action, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a blood elf in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.

A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd's delight, and his own tactical advantage. His opponent's sword flares with blue light an instant before she sends lightning forth to smite him.

### Ancient Practice
For as long as war has raged, heroes from every race have aimed to master the art of battle. Warriors combine strength, leadership, and a vast knowledge of arms and armor to wreak havoc in glorious combat. Some protect from the front lines with shields, locking down enemies while allies support the warrior from behind with spell and bow. Others forgo the shield and unleash their rage at the closest threat with a variety of deadly weapons. 

The warrior’s battle cries embolden friends and leave foes cowering in fear. With legendary precision, warriors target the smallest gaps in armor and slice at hamstrings in a blur of steel. Every dragon slain, corrupted tyrant toppled, and demon banished from Azeroth has trembled in the face of these lords of war.

Warriors are the quintessential fearless fighters on the battlefield, and their pure martial prowess inspires courage in allies and despair in enemies. Experts in all manner of melee weaponry and possessing incredible physical strength and skill, Warriors are perfectly suited to serve as frontline combatants and battlefield commanders.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:670px;'></div>

### Well-Rounded Specialists
Warriors learn the basics of all combat styles. Every warrior can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a warrior is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on protection their allies from mortal blows, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some prefer a single large weapon able to be wielded with extraordinary force. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.

### Creating a Warrior
As you build your warrior, think about two related elements of your character's background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane fighters around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication?

    You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble's army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught -- unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms. Or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions -- the only things that stand between you and death's embrace.

<!-- #### Rage Reserve
You can use a bonus action on your turn to tap into your inner reserve of rage and gain a number of Rage Dice equal to the Rage Reserve column of the Warrior table.

#### Maneuvers
You start knowing one maneuver of your choice. Most maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. Unless otherwise stated, you can use only one maneuver per attack.

Whenever you gain levels in this class, you can choose one of the maneuvers you have learned and replace it with another maneuver you could learn at that level. 

#### Saving Throws
Saving Throws. Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

<div style="text-align: Center">

\pagebreakNum

## Martial Archetypes
Different warriors choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach.

### Arms
Arms warriors are forged not in the classroom, tavern, or workshop, but in the dueling pits and on the arena floor. These warriors are patient fighters, waiting to capitalize on moments when their opponent is left exposed. Many arms warrior gravitate towards two-headed weapons, weapons that allow them to deliver devastating, overpowering blows, fully exploiting their enemies’ weaknesses.

#### Overpower
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to use your weapon as a barrier. When you are hit by a melee attack, you can use you reaction to roll 1d10 and add the total to your Armor Class. If your overpower causes the attack to miss you, you can make one weapon attack against the target as part of the same reaction.

You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Dauntless
At 3rd level, your rage is replenished even as you pour it into your attacks. You regain 1 rage at the end of your turn if you hit a creature with a rage move during it.

#### Commanding Shout
Starting at 7th level, you are able to command an ally to attack your quarry. As a bonus action, choose a friendly creature within 60 feet of you who can see or hear you. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make <br> one melee weapon attack.

#### Colossus Smash
Upon reaching 11th level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack on your turn, you may sunder their defenses and give the next weapon attack made against the target before the end of your next turn advantage. You may only use colossus smash once on each of your turns.

#### Deadly Calm
Starting at 15th level, you instinctively enter a defensive stance when things get rough. While you are below half <br> of your hit point maximum, you have advantage on any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw you make.

#### Opportunity Strikes
At 18th level, you respond to openings in enemies defense with unmatched ferocity. In combat, you get a special reaction that you can take once on every creature's turn, except your turn. You can use this special reaction only to make an opportunity attack, and you can't use it on the same turn that you take your normal reaction.

\columnbreak

### Fury
Fury warriors are among the most feared of combatants, these fearless fighters venture into the fray with a lust for battle, disregarding their own defense to deliver punishing blows with brute force. Many fury warriors favor weapons capable of being wielded in one-hand to unleash a flurry of attacks carving their opponent to pieces.

#### Rampage
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to rampage. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

#### Fearful
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill if you don't already have it and when you make an ability check with it, you can choose to use your Strength modifier instead of your Charisma modifier for the check.

#### Single-Minded Fury
Starting at 7th level, your brutish strength allows you to wield weapons with might unmatched by other warriors. 

When you wield a weapon that deals a single damage die, the damage die of the weapon is increased by 1. For example, a shortsword that normally deals 1d6 damage instead deals 1d8 damage. A weapon's damage die can't <br> be increased beyond a 1d12.

#### Thirst for Blood
At 11th level, when a hostile creature within 20 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed towards the creature without provoking oppor­tunity attacks. If this movement brings you within reach of the creature, you may make one weapon attack against the creature as part of the reaction.

#### Devastating Critical
Beginning at 15th level, when you score a critical hit with a weapon attack, you gain a bonus to that weapon’s damage roll equal to your level in this class.

#### Frothing Berserker
At 18th level, if you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points and doesn't kill you outright, you can use your reaction to delay falling unconscious and immediately take an extra turn. While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn, taking damage causes death saving throw failures as normal, and three death saving throw failures can still kill you. When the extra turn ends, you fall unconscious if you still have 0 hit points. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Protection
Protection warriors demonstrate a knack for the use of a shield, nullifying opponent’s advances and creating oppor­tunities for counterattacks. For them, being the toughest soldier on the front means nothing if allies are left vulner­able to the enemy's attack. These stalwart defenders are integral to the success of any military campaign. 

#### Taunt
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you can use your action to taunt creatures within 30 feet of you. Any creature of your choice
within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Rage save DC or have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the save at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. 

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Anger Management
At 3rd level, your rage is renewed by blows made against you. When a hostile creature hits you with an attack, you immediately gain 1 rage point. You can only benefit from this effect once per turn.

#### Intercept
Beginning at 7th level, when a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to intercept the attack, forcing the attack to target you instead.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). You regain all spent uses after finishing a long rest.

#### Softened Blows
Beginning at 11th level, even the strongest of blows will not fault your defense. Any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit and you have advantage on any check or saving throw made to avoid being knocked prone.

#### Inspiring Presence
Starting at 15th level, you can extend the benefit of your Indomitable feature to an ally. When you use Indomitable to reroll an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw and you aren't incapacitated, you can choose one ally within 60 feet of you that also failed its save against the same effect. If that creature can see or hear you, it can reroll its saving throw and must use the new roll.

#### Never Surrender
At 18th level, whenever you start your turn below half of your hit point maximum, you gain 1d10 + your Constitution modifier temporary hit points. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.

## Rage Maneuvers
If a rage maneuver has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the maneuver at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

#### Berserker Rage
You can use your action and spend 3 rage points to end one effect that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

\columnbreak

#### Bloodthirst
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 3 rage points to bolster yourself in the moment. When done, you gain temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Warrior level. These hit points lasts  for 1 minute.

#### Cleave
*Prerequisite: 6th level*
<div style='margin-top:-6px;'></div>

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 4 rage to attempt to cleave another creature with the same attack.

Bladestorm
Prerequisite. 1 level in Warrior
You may enter this stance with an action.
While in this stance, you whirl with your
weapon outstretched, automatically dealing
your melee weapon damage to all creatures
within the weapon‘s reach of you. This
damage is treated as an area effect. Affected
targets are entitled an Agility saving throw to
halve the damage. You can apply strike
effects, but they affect only targets who failed
their saving throw, and one strike affects one
target.
You cannot take any other actions in this
stance other than maintaining it. You can
enter this stance a number of times equal to
your proficiency bonus before replenishing
on a short rest, and the effects of it remaining
until the beginning of your turn in the next
round unless you extend it using the same
actions.
While in this stance, you have advantage
against all movement-impairing effects or
effects that result in loss of control for your
character, and you do not provoke reactions
from movement from a creature who has
failed their saving throw to half damage.
Your speed, however, is halved in this stance.

If you are unable to use your action, or if you
cannot move at least 5 feet every round, this
stance ends. If you are in this stance more
than 3 rounds, you gain the incapacitated
condition for after you are finished. The
condition remains for 1 round per round you
were in the stance beyond the first three.


Berserker Rage

Prerequisite. Must be taken at 1st level of
Warrior.
You may cast the berserker frenzy spell on
yourself as a bonus action. This rage
continues until you end it with a bonus
action, or until the rage ends early (as per the
spell‘s description), and you can use it as
limited by the spell‘s description.
This spell cannot be dispelled, but can be
overwhelmed by a calm emotions spell or
similar effect that would suppress this ability,
and does not prevent use of spell-like abilities
derived from talents.
You can take this talent again. If you do so,
you do not gain a level of exhaustion at the
end (regardless of how long you rage).
If you reach 9th level of Warrior, your rage
only ends if you are knocked unconscious or
if you end it willingly.

Hamstring
As a strike, you may target a target‘s
hamstring. If successful, the target‘s
movement speed is reduced by half. Also,
whenever they use the Dash action, they also
fall prone. The target may use an action to
roll a Stamina saving throw against this
ability, which ends the condition. An ally of
the target may make the saving throw instead
as a Spirit (Medicine) check instead if they
are within reach of the target. It ends
automatically at the end of a short rest.
This is a strike effect. This strike can be used
a number of times equal to your proficiency
bonus, with the uses replenishing at the end
of a short rest.


Heroic Leap
Prerequisite. 1 level in Monk or Warrior
You are capable of making powerful leaps.
While moving, you may make a heroic leap,
moving twice your normal horizontal and
vertical jump distance (as if you were affected
by the jump spell). If you spend an action at
the end of the movement, it is enhanced in
the following ways.
 Melee Attack. You gain advantage to
the attack roll. After resolving the
attack (but whether it is a success or
failure), you may damage the terrain
you land on, turning a 5-foot radius
sphere (centered on you) into
difficult terrain. A target that is

already on the terrain must succeed
on an Agility saving throw or be
pushed 5 feet away from you or
knocked prone (your choice).
 Ranged Attack. You gain advantage
to your ranged attack roll. If you miss
your primary target, compare either
roll results to another target within
your weapon range. If that would
have resulted in a hit, resolve your
attack against them instead.
 Dash. You benefit from both the
Dash and Dodge actions until the
end of your turn. If you are required
to make a check to jump over an
obstacle or grab hold of a ledge, you
gain advantage to that roll.
Once used, this talent cannot be used again
until after a short rest. Only warriors and
monks may take this talent.

monks may take this talent.


Shout
Prerequisite. 1 level in Warrior
As an action, you channel your warrior spirit
into powerful battlefield commands (called
shouts, but can vary from inspiring
commands, battle-warnings, or a litany or
warrior chant).
You can use any of the below shouts a
number of times equal to 1 + your Stamina
or Charisma modifier (choose one),
replenishing after a short or long rest. The
effects of the shout remain for 1 minute or
unless the shout‘s effects specify otherwise
(whichever is shorter). Using a different
shout ends the effects of the previous shout.
 Battle Shout. You cast the
abandonment aura spell.

 Defensive Shout. You cast the devotion
aura spell.
 Disruptive Shout (requires 7th level).
You cast the distraction aura spell.
 Halting. One target within range has
their speed halved. You can use this
shout as a reaction.
 Invigorating. One target within range
increases their maximum hit points
by 3. This can stack for each bonus
action you use, reaching of one-half
your level for one hour, or double
their maximum hit points (whichever
is lower)
 Inspiring. One target within range or
can spend a single healing dice to
heal themselves. A creature that
benefits from this shout cannot
benefit from it again until they
complete a short or long rest.
 Marching Orders (requires 5th level).
You cast the crusader aura spell.
 Rallying. One target within range is
affected as if you cast the heroism
spell (treat your Stamina modifier as
the relevant spellcasting modifier).
 Reordering. One target within range
can move up to one-quarter their
speed as their reaction. If you
maintain this shout in the next
round, you can choose the same
target or another one.
 Taunt. You cast the compelled duel
spell. You can choose an additional
target for the spell for every two
levels above 5th level.
 Terrifying Howl. You cast the cause fear
spell. You can choose an additional
target for the spell for every two
levels above 5th level.
 Startling Cry. One target within range
suffers disadvantage to their attack
rolls. You can activate this shout as a
reaction if the attack takes place
outside your turn, and you may
maintain it on your turn and choose
another target with a bonus action. A
creature that suffers from this shout

cannot be affected from it again until
you complete a short or long rest.
Shouts have a range of 30 feet, or the range
of the spell the shout specifies.
If the target of a shout leaves the range or is
defeated, the effect ends for them, even if
they return to the area again. A shout is a
thunder effect that does not function in areas
of silence or if you cannot vocalize.
Special. If you have proficiency in musical
instruments, you can use them to apply a
bonus to your shouts appropriate to the
musical instrument type.
 Brass (trumpet, cornet, tuba, etc.).
Clarion. Any saving throw done
against your active shouts, or any
attempts to dispel your spells
channeled through a brass
instrument suffer disadvantage (if the
dispel would be automatic, it instead
requires a check regardless of spell
level).
 Percussion (drums, triangle, bells, etc.).
Resonance. The range of your shouts
channeled through your instrument
increases by 50%.
 Strings (violin, cello, harp, dulcimer, etc.).
Lingering. Your last shout lingers for
an extra minute after its duration
ends. This cannot exceed the
maximum duration of the spell or
shout (if any), but can allow you to
effectively maintain multiple shouts.
 Woodwinds (flutes, clarinet, ocarina,
etc.). Synthesized. Shouts that provide
numerical bonuses increase the
bonus by +1.

Stunning Slam
Upon scoring a critical hit with a melee
weapon, you can stun your target for until

the end of your turn in the next round. This
can be negated with a successful Stamina
saving throw. This is a strike effect.

Thunder Clap
You may use your action to cast the
thunderwave spell by slamming your weapon
into the ground, releasing a wave of force.
This acts as the spell with the following
differences:
 If you use a weapon with the Heavy
property or are wielding one weapon
in either hand, you may add your
Strength or Agility modifier (choose
one) to the damage roll.
 Instead of being pushed on a failed
saving throw, targets can instead
suffer the chilled condition for until
the start of their turn in the next
round.
 You may center the effect on
yourself, in which case the spell‘s
area changes to a 15-foot radius
sphere centered on you.
The spell‘s level is equal to one-half your
own. This is a supernatural ability. Once this
ability is used, it cannot be used again until
after a short or long rest.

Wind Walk
Prerequisite. 1 level in Monk or Warrior
You may use your action to wind-walk,
rendering yourself invisible as per the
invisibility spell, and increase your land speed
by 10 feet.
This stance ends if you end your turn
without moving at least one-half your
movement speed in a single direction.
If you make an attack roll while invisible this
way, you score a critical hit on a roll of 15-20,
and you then end the invisibility effect. This
is a supernatural ability.
Once this talent is used, it cannot be used
again until after a short or long rest.
