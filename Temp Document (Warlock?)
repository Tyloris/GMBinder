### Soul Shards
*2nd-level warlock feature*
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You can create soul shards: small crystals formed from fragments of souls and spirits, which you can expend to empower your warlock spells and abilities. You start knowing **the abilities listed below** and learn more as you gain more levels in the warlock class. 

You can have a number of soul shards at any given time up to your proficiency bonus; attempting to create an additional soul shard results in a useless dull crystal. Soul shards last until used, at which point they disappear. If a soul shard leaves your possession for more than 8 hours, it disappears. Soul shards you create can only be used by you; soul shards created by other warlocks are useless.

Over the course of a rest, you can gather fragments of wandering souls to create soul shards. You can create a single soul shard over the span of a short rest, or any number over a long rest.

Additionally, you can capture part of the escaping souls of nearby dying creatures in the form of soul shards. When an appropriate creature within 60 feet of you dies, you can use your reaction to create a single soul shard.

What constitutes an appropriate creature is up to a DM's discretion, but a guideline is listed in the **Creature Soul Shards** sidebar. 

You can expend a soul shard you are touching to create one of the following effects:

<!-- 
***Bolster Life.*** You can expend a soul shard as a bonus action to grant yourself temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier + your warlock level.

***Siphon Knowledge.*** You can use a bonus action to expend a soul shard, bolstering yourself with the soul's life experience and making your next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage. If you don't use this benefit before the start of your next turn, it is lost.

***Casting Circle.*** You can expend a soul shard as a bonus action to create a 5-foot radius circle of demonic runes to appear on the ground. As long as you remain in this circle, you have advantage on concentration checks. The circle fades after 1 minute.
-->

> ##### Creature Soul Shards
> Soul shards are only useful if they are created from sufficiently dense spirit energy or complex souls. While some exceptions exist, the following guidelines typically hold true:
> - All humanoids can produce soul shards.
> - Most undead and almost all constructs cannot produce soul shards.
> - All other creature types typically only produce soul shards if their souls are sufficiently complex: i.e., their CRs are 1/8 and above.

### Dark Grimoire
*3rd-level warlock feature* 
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div> 

**Flavor text goes here.** You gain one of the following features of your choice.

**[Each should provide a base ability and unique soul shard spender at 3rd level and upgrade at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels.]**

#### Grimoire of Artifice

You can craft items of power.

***Soulbound Focus.*** You have learned a secret ritual to imbue an arcane focus with a fraction of your power, utilizing it to enhance your spells. You can perform a ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done on a short rest. The arcane focus must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.

**LEFT OFF HERE: (Nobdoy else can use your focus as a focus.)**



At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.

Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.

You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.

Awakened Spellbook
Using specially prepared inks and ancient incantations passed down by your wizardly order, you have awakened an arcane sentience within your spellbook.

At 2nd level, while you are holding the book, it grants you the following benefits:

You can use the book as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.
When you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot, you can temporarily replace its damage type with a type that appears in another spell in your spellbook, which magically alters the spell's formula for this casting only. The latter spell must be of the same level as the spell slot you expend.
When you cast a wizard spell as a ritual, you can use the spell's normal casting time, rather than adding 10 minutes to it. Once you use this benefit, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
If necessary, you can replace the book over the course of a short rest by using your Wizardly Quill to write arcane sigils in a blank book or a magic spellbook to which you're attuned. At the end of the rest, your spellbook's consciousness is summoned into the new book, which the consciousness transforms into your spellbook, along with all its spells. If the previous book still existed somewhere, all the spells vanish from its pages.

***Bonded Item.*** You can craft a powerful arcane focus known as a bonded item. While touching your bonded item, you can attempt to cast a cantrip you don't know from the warlock spell list. To do so, you must succeed at a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check, otherwise the spell fails and your action is wasted.

If you lose your bonded item, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to craft a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous focus. The item turns to ash when you die.

When you reach 5th level, while holding the focus you also gain a +1 bonus to the spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of your warlock spells. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and to +3 at 17th level.

**[This is just the magician's hat and rod of the pact keeper magic items. Too dull? Seems like a decent trade off for no demons, power-wise.]**

**[You can use the magician's hat ability an additional time per day when you get upgrades?]**

***Craft Spellstone.*** You can turn a soul shard into a spellstone. The process takes 1 minute to complete and you can only have one spellstone at a time; if you create a second spellstone, your previous spellstone crumbles.

A newly created spellstone has a number of charges equal to your proficiency bonus. While the spellstone is within 5 feet of you, you can expend one charge to gain one of the following benefits:
- When you cast a spell, you can add your Intelligence modifier (minimum +1) to the damage it deals on a hit.
- If you take damage from a spell, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by your Intelligence modifier + your warlock level.

#### Grimoire of Infusion
You learn to infuse yourself with stolen life force.

***Fel Armor.*** While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier. 

**[Inspiration: [Demon Armor (Classic)](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Demon_Armor_(Classic)), [Fel Armor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Fel_Armor), and similar effects.]**

**[Ideas:]**
- Regain hp when dealing damage. Roll for chance?
- Slow out-of-combat healing.
- Can add/replace Intelligence for other saving throws.
- Increases amount of health regained when healed.
- Increases health regen.
- Grants fire, necrotic, poison resistance.
- Can use Int for melee attacks
- Increased AC

***Stolen Life.*** You can expend a soul shard as a bonus action to grant yourself temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier + your warlock level.

\pagebreak

#### Grimoire of Knowledge
You gain additional insights into the soul, empowering your mind and magic.

***Forbidden Knowledge.*** When you gain this feature, and again at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels, you can choose one of the following options. You can choose the same feature multiple times, choosing new targets for the ability whenever you do. 
- Choose one of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the chosen proficiency.
- Choose two spells from any class, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast with your Fel Sorcery or Nethermancy features, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as warlock spells for you and do not count against your number of spells known.
- Choose a warlock spell you know of 1st level. You can cast that spell at will without expending a spell slot. The maximum level of the spell you can select increases to 2nd level at 11th level, and to 3rd level at 17th level. **[Steps on toes of wizard/mage capstones? Can be abused, like using animate dead?]**

***Siphon Skill.*** You can use a bonus action to expend a soul shard, bolstering yourself with the soul's life experience and making your next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage. If you don't use this benefit before the start of your next turn, it is lost.


#### Grimoire of Sacrifice
When you touch the athame to a creature that died since the beginning of your last turn... [That's all I got so far.]

#### Grimoire of Servitude
You learn the secrets of defined boundaries and binding magic.

***Demonic Minion.*** You can summon and bind a demonic minion into your service at the end of a long rest. Your minion acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. You initially know how to summon one type of minion, selected from the list at the end of the class description. You learn how to summon an additional type of minion at 5th, 11th, and 17th level.

Once summoned, a demonic minion remains until it is slain or dismissed. You can temporarily dismiss your minion as an action. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

When the minion drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. If the demon has died within the last hour, you can expend a soul shard as an action to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of the location of its death. The demon returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.

In combat, it shares your initiative and takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on it's own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take one of the actions in its stat block or the Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide or Search action.

\pagebreak

***Magic Circle.*** You can expend a soul shard as a bonus action to create a 5-foot-radius, 10-foot-tall cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within 10 feet. Glowing demonic runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface. The circle lasts for 1 minute, or until you use this feature again.

Whenever you create a magic circle, you choose one of the following effects to apply:
- You have advantage on concentration checks while within the circle. **[Second feature?]**
- The circle can be used as an alternative material component for the *summon lesser demons* ^XGE^ and *summon greater demon* ^XGE^ spells, as though it were a consumed vial of blood. When used this way, the circle lasts until the spell ends.
- Creatures within the circle gain the benefit of the *sanctuary* spell (using your warlock spell save DC) against fiends, demons, and aberrations. If a creature within the circle makes an attack against or casts a spell on an enemy fiend, demon, or aberration, the circle immediately fades.
- Spells you cast can exclude the area within the circle from their area of effect. Creatures must be fully within the circle to benefit from this effect.

>***Slow (Recharge 5–6).*** The golem targets one or more creatures it can see within 10 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic. On a failed save, a target can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
