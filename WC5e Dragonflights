## Dragons
Among the greatest of all living beings on the face of Azeroth, dragons are creatures who live up to their many legends. Their power is great as great as their beauty is majestic; a tremendous force to be reckoned with. 

Mature dragons are often larger than other creatures they might encounter, and their fangs and claws strong enough to destroy who might oppose them. To top it all off, most dragons are fortified further still with innate magical power. All of this taken into consideration, it is easy to see how their history is intricately twined with that of Azeroth itself -- in ways that few other beings can boast.

Their connection with the world is innate; born from both their heritage and from the power of the Dragon Aspects. With its first breath of life, a dragon will weave a bond with the world with the world around it, and when its death comes to pass it does so to a tremendous upheaval; causing earthquakes, floods, and suchlike.

Even young dragons, those who have not established as close a bond to the spiritual world, still make ripples in the fabric of reality when they die. Although these ripples are not always seen or felt by other races, they nonetheless garner the attention of other dragons.

### Dragon Lives

The life spans of dragons have not been accurately measured, but they are known to live for several centuries. A dragon begins its life as a **whelp** (or whelpling), growing from there in both size and power until it becomes a **drake** within five to ten years. After about a century or so, a drake reaches full maturity as a **dragon** -- before taking centuries therafter to become a **wyrm**.

### Interacting With Dragons
Each dragon is as individual as any mortal creature. They have their dreams, personality, quirks, and traits to make them stand out on their own. Still, there are a number of similarities that run through each dragonflight, and some that run through dragons as a whole. Some of these similarities are innate, others cultural, and others still drawn from painful lessons learned in ages past.

***Distant and Grand.*** Dragons interact with the mortal races with fair infrequency. They prefer the company of their own kind, or even complete isolation, to that of creatures whose lives can be measured in mere decades. In this light, if they do have to deal with mortals, they are often more inclined to interact with longer-lived races -- elves in particular, and often dwarves as well.

There is an exception to this tendency with the green and red dragonflights. Green dragons, as protectors of the natural world and the Emerald Dream, sometimes seek the aid of druids and their allies. Red dragons, in their part as protectors of life, are said to discreetly seek out mortals for the satisfaction of secretly living among them.

***Long Perspective.*** Whatever the situation, it is typical for a dragon to take a sometimes exceptionally long approach; content to seed events that may not see fruition for decades, or even centuries. As long as their lives can last, sometimes even reaching millennia, they are rarely wont for time to see their plans through to the end.

In the company of mortals, a dragon may very well forget that such creatures often prefer plans to take form in just a few years -- or even sooner, if possible!

***A Familiar Form.***  Dragons of the five flights are masters of true shapeshifting; at will, they may shrink and alter their shape to match any mortal race. Though this is often used to retain a disguise, particularly by the Bronze dragons who may wish to walk among history, the most common use of this trick is actually free of deceit. 

Many dragons will choose a mortal form that they find comfortable, and which reflects their personality or true self; sometimes retaining draconic features such as horns, crests or unique armor, and otherwise being fully open that they are dragons still. This is often used to liaise with much smaller mortals, but some dragons far prefer to stand as mortals even in spare time, perhaps finding it freeing from the shape granted to them by birth.

### Dragonflights
Dragons are grouped together by type, referred to as dragonflights. There are only five true or "greater" dragonflights, each headed by a Dragon Aspect: black, blue, bronze, green, and red. From these have spawned at least three lesser dragonflights--infinite, netherwing, and twilight--who are the results of unnatural circumstances. All other dragons do not qualify as true dragonflights, though laymen sometimes refer to them as such.

Each of the greater dragonflights has a location where they go to when their life is at an end, known as a dragonshrine. Each of the dragonshrines--the Obsidian, Azure, Bronze, Emerald, and Ruby Dragonshrines for black, blue, bronze, green, and red dragons respectively--is considered sacred for every dragonflight and is located in the region of Northrend known as Dragonblight. Nearby is the Wyrmrest Temple, an immense Titan structure used as an ancient meeting place for the five dragonflights.

### The Dragon Aspects
Long ago, the titan-forged Keeper Tyr stood against Galakrond, an immense beast known as the Father of Dragons, who consumed other proto-dragons to increase his horrific power. It was only with the aid of five remarkable proto-dragons who stood by his side that Tyr was victorious.

These five proto-dragons were Alexstrasza, Malygos, Neltharion, Nozdormu, and Ysera. By the power of the Titans, they were each transformed into the first dragons and bestowed the title of Aspect.

They were immortal, given charge of each their own domain on Azeroth and the tremendous power to keep it. With them, other dragons who shared kinship with any of the five were held to the same charge. They would watch over all aspects of life with vigilance, feeling the weight of their responsibilities upon their very souls. 

### Dragons
As a dragon grows older, each stage of its life is distinctly unique from the last; not only growing larger, but also considerably more powerful. These stages are generally similar across all greater and lesser dragonflights.

#### Dragonwhelp
A dragonwhelp typically measures around 4 ft. from its snout to its tail as it emerges from its egg -- in which it has already been conscious for some time. Though physically weak, and thus rarely left alone, even a newly hatched whelp hold a significant magical aptitude.

\columnbreak

#### Drake
It only takes a few years for a whelp to become a drake, a fairly explosive growth by any measure, before staying as such for decades to come. Given to their youth, drakes on their own can be quick to act; preferring swift and decisive action over the slow deliberation of their older kin. 

#### Dragon
By the time a drake has reached full maturity as a dragon, a century or more, it has had more than enough time to experience the world -- and to draw wisdom from it. Even among flights who keep close together, a mature dragon is very likely try and keep its own lair secluded.

#### Wyrm
Should a dragon live long enough, centuries down the line, it will eventually become a wyrm. They are the oldest and most venerable of their flight, keeping scores of dragons under their wings and within their domain, standing second only to the Aspects themselves. 

**[Unique appearance descriptor: Maybe throw in a brief description in the Wyrm section that adds what physical attributes make them distinct - specifically longer beards, horns, frills, moustaches, unique tail clubs, whatever. Might help DMs.]**

**[Note: Apparently the unique descriptors for certain Aspects, like Alexstrasza's oversized horns, are supposed to be reflected in the dragonflight as a whole--ie, all red dragons have larger horns. The fact that they share a single model is due to graphical limitations.]**

### Dragonkin
There are other creatures that serve the dragonflights, usually under the command of older dragons and wyrms. Though they are not true dragons themselves, they all remain closely tied members of their respective flight.

How these creatures came to be is a well-guarded secret, known only to the dragons themselves; none of whom are particularly forthcoming with this information. 

#### Dragonspawn
The dragonspawn are monstrous beings trained to guard and to care for their respective dragonflight; acting as soldiers, assistants, or even companions. Just like the dragons themselves, they are endowed with a great number of virtuous qualities and mystic abilities.

Drawing comparisons to other creatures, they share similarities with centaurs -- having a lower body with four legs and a humanoid upper body with arms. Unlike centaurs however, they are lizard-like in every way; their bodies decked in scales. Some have been seen to have wings, though never large enough to permit flight.

#### Drakonid
The drakonid are typically described as half-man, half-dragon -- though just like with the dragonspawn, a dragon would never confirm whether there is anything to draw from this observation or if it is merely a coincidence.

They are towering creatures that walk on two legs, reaching far taller than any mortal that would cross their path, and make great use of their impressive strength in the work they do for the flight they serve.

### Greater Dragonflights
In ages past, when the largest of dragons, Galakrond, reigned over the land, scores of proto-dragons of countless colours flitted across the skies of ancient Kalimdor. Through time and change, few remain, and those that have stood the test of time and risen most to prominence are called the Greater Dragonflights, or Prime Dragonflights; blessed by the gods of Azeroth, the five flights - red, black, blue, bronze, and green - were charged with safeguarding Azeroth, and representing the fundamental forces of nature.

***The Dragon Aspects.*** Each of the dragonflights has a charge, a sacred duty, and among them no dragon exemplifies their role than the Dragon Aspect, each one empowered as an aspect of their granted domain, the ruler of their flight and typically the mother or father of most of it. These five dragons are the oldest, wisest and by far the most powerful of dragonkind, closer to gods than any other creature on Azeroth. They possess wisdom and memory aeons long, and seek nothing less than total peace across Azeroth, for the sake of her occupants and their own children.

***The Charge of the Dragonflights.*** Each dragonflight has been charged with an eternal duty, and each dragon within their birth flight possesses fantastic powers pertaining to their charge. Intelligent from the egg, each dragon takes their flight's charge extremely seriously, and it is a rare dragon that is not acting in their brood's best interests. Between flights there has been some contention, from derisive belief in other broods' "inferior" charges to competition, but the dragonflights collectively understand that, when all is done, their charge is for the good of Azeroth, not themselves.

#### Black Dragonflight
Where the other flights are kind, loyal or focused on Azeroth's protection, the black dragonflight are cruel, backstabbing and obsessed with the destruction of life, and toppling of kingdoms.

Long ago, the Black Dragonflight and its elder were charged with the protection over the Earth itself, and given a deep and intimate connection to Azeroth. In those days, the dragonflight were Azeroth's most ardent and stalwart defenders, able in one breath to extinguish and re-ignite a volcano, willing to go to any length to defend their friends, and eternally vigilant of corruption in the heart of Azeroth.

However, at the turn of an age, the Aspect of Earth was driven insane, and corrupted his entire brood with that same insanity. A war that ended in calamity for dragonkind cemented the Black Dragonflight's place as the betrayers, the dragons of death and evil, and enemies of all of Azeroth.

#### Blue Dragonflight
Granted the grand task of watching over the realm of magic and enchantment across Azeroth, to ensure that the planet's latent powers are never abused, the Blue Dragonflight have perhaps the loftiest attitude towards their role, and perform it with feeling.

Almost driven to extinction at the advent of the Black Dragonflight's turn to evil, the blue flight is reclusive and secular, refusing any interaction with mortals with few exceptions and hoarding arcane knowledge and artifacts for themselves in their cultural home in Northrend. A blue dragon is an intensely intelligent, crafty being, inclined more towards riddles and puzzles than to combat and active duty. They take immense (and not unwarranted) pride in their skills and knowledge, and will take any chance possible to avail those nearby with their achievements.

#### Bronze Dragonflight
The bronze dragonflight was charged not over earth or magic, or any tangible thing; rather, they were charged to ensure that time passes as it should, that the future goes unaltered and that the past stays past. To this end, they were granted power over time itself, able to travel through the endless Caverns of Time to catch and halt those who would seek to change the past.

Due to their wide perspective and confusing travel between times, the bronzes are known to be extremely distant and out of tune with current events; indeed, they consider direct intervention to be only for the utmost of emergencies. Because of this, they are arguably the rarest seen of all dragons, although it is sometimes claimed that they are the most common users of mortal disguise.

#### Green Dragonflight
Ethereal and distant, the green dragonflight was charged with a role inextricably linked to all the others, but inevitably distinct; they and their leader were charged to watch over the Emerald Dream, and to uphold the life and soul of nature across Azeroth. Ever-sleeping, the emerald dragons have all but abandoned their worldly bodies that their spirits may watch over the Emerald Dream, the pristine and mystical mirror of the material world.  It is said that the greens may perceive both these realities at once, interwoven with one another.

Invariably kind spirited and gentle, these dragons will help those who seek to defend Azeroth whenever they can, though their means to do so on the material world are limited.

#### Red Dragonflight
Caring and gentle, though potentially fearsome and protective, the Red Dragonflight were charged to represent life itself in all its forms, but mortal life most of all. to them, all mortal creatures are like children to be protected, and the reds feel a deep obligation to see that the world's history progresses in such a way, though war and death will happen, that mortals are yet able to live and die as mortals, rather than as food to global threats, or fodder to cruel invasions.

Subsequently the red tend to be quite hands-off, preferring to interact with mortals - should they have to - in disguise, seeing that things are progressing smoothly. By preference, however, the ruby dragons will simply bide and live, keeping an eye open for greater threats, but otherwise content to let the world tick on as it should.

### Black Dragonflight
*"My blessing upon you will seem humble compared to those which have been bestowed upon the others: the managing of time, of life, of dreams and magic. I offer you the earth. The soil, the ground, the deep places. But know that the earth is the basis of all things. It is where we are rooted. Where you must come from, if you are to go to. Here is whence true strength comes. From deep places... within the world, and within oneself."*

</div>

<div style='margin-top:20px;'></div>

*"Silence! If you insist on calling it a gift, so be it. Know then what it is to be me, to be given this gracious gift... to feel the fiery heart of this world as your own. Know what it is to feel the weight of this dying world on your shoulders. Does the gift taste as sweet as you thought it would? This is what the other Aspects wish: to chain you to this world as I have been. To damn you to a life of eternal torment."*

<div style="text-align:Right">

*— The Black Aspect, Deathwing*

</div>

Black scales, the deepest colors of onyx and ebony; eyes that burn red with the flame within, and a similar crimson glow visible deep within their throat when they give a mighty roar; black dragons are a sight to behold. Charged with the protection of the earth, and bearers of its strength, the black dragonflight is one of great power.

***Defenders of Azeroth.*** For a time, black dragons were once defenders of Azeroth. They shaped the lands, created mountains and valleys, and represented the strength of the earth. For millennia they defended Azeroth from destruction, until they fell from grace.

***Corrupted Champions.*** At an unknown point, whisperings of the Old Gods corrupted the black dragons, especially their Aspect and leader, Neltharion. During the War of the Ancients, Neltharion was instrumental in the creation of the Dragon Soul; this was ostensibly to defeat the Burning Legion, but Neltharion used it to betray his allies.

With the Legion all but defeated, Neltharion turned the Dragon Soul on the night elves and dragons who had been his allies. Only the timely arrival of Korialstrasz, consort of the red dragonqueen, saved them all from certain death.

***Enemies of Azeroth.*** The betrayal was so great that the other dragonflights never truly recovered, and the ensuing war between dragons further damaged the species. Black dragons were hunted down and nearly annihilated, their numbers reduced to very few. From that point forward they served as infrequent but deadly threats to all.

During much of this time, Neltharion — now called Deathwing — was rarely seen. After a series of setbacks and a defeat at the hands of the other Aspects, he retreated to Deepholm in the Elemental Plane. Many thought he was defeated forever, but they were very wrong.

***Cataclysmic Threat.*** After the fall of the Lich King, Deathwing made his return. He fractured the World Pillar, which caused the Cataclysm and reshaped much of the surface of Azeroth. He and the black dragonflight brought the world to its knees, but were ultimately defeated by brave heroes. At their side fought Wrathion, an uncorrupted black dragonwhelp who represented hope for the future.

### Black Dragon Lairs
Black dragons lair in caves and caverns near volcanic activity, such as hot springs or magma veins. 

[Obsidian Dragonshrine, volcanoes.]

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
- Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If any of the effect's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.
- The dragon causes up to six corpses within the lair to rise as skeletons, zombies, or ghouls. These undead obey its telepathic commands, which can reach anywhere in the lair. 
- Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads a round corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.

#### Regional Effects
The region containing a legendary black dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
- Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted by sulfur.
- Magma rises close to the surface, often spilling out of cracks in a 1 mile radius of the lair.
- Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.

Wreathed in swirls and eddies of snow-dusted air, blue dragons are covered in lustrous scales of azure blue and silvery white. The air around them is often cold. Magic is the domain of the blue dragonflight; they are charged with its use and care, for the power of magic is not to be taken lightly.

***Tending the Arcane.*** Led by the Aspect Malygos, and his mate Sindragosa, the blue dragonflight tended arcane magic for millennia. Native to the northern reaches that would one day become Northrend, they conducted many experiments. They even discovered other realms of existence, and spent much time watching over those who practiced magic.

***Betrayal and Death.*** During the War of the Ancients, the blue dragonflight was betrayed. When Deathwing used the Dragon Soul to turn on his allies, he all but wiped out the blue dragons. Malygos — overwhelmed by the loss of his mate, his friend Neltharion, and most of his kin — fell into a grief-stricken madness. The few blue dragons who remained, and a few remaining blue dragon eggs, were the flight's only hope for the future.

<div style='margin-top:30px;'></div>

    ***The Nexus War.*** Some while after the defeat of Illidan, Malygos seemed to wake from his madness. He concluded that the mortal races had caused too much destruction with their reckless pursuit of power. He and the newly resurgent blue flight declared war on the Kirin Tor and began to siphon the magic of Azeroth, so that it could not be misused, but this had destructive effects on the world. Their efforts became so destructive that Alexstrsza and the other aspects saw no other course but to destroy Malygos.

***Spread to the Winds.*** No other dragonflight at that time had ever suffered the death of an Aspect. Leaderless, and without the guiding power of the Aspect in whom had been placed the power over arcane magic, the blue dragonflight was devastated once again. With the final destruction of Deathwing, this became a moot point, as the Aspects lost their immortality and much of their power.

Their numbers reduced yet again, lacking an Aspect, the blue dragonflight effectively dissolved. Blue dragons went their own way, each choosing their home and their goals as they saw fit. Most retained the dragonkin that were already in their service, but kept little contact with one another.

### Blue Dragon Lairs
[Azure Dragonshrine, the Nexus, ley line confluences.]

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
- The dragon rolls a d8 and regains an expended innate spell of that level or lower. If it has no spent spells of that level or lower, nothing happens.
- The dragon targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. An *antimagic field* fills the space of the target, moving with it until initiative count 20 on the next round.

#### Regional Effects
The region containing a legendary blue dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
- Blue crystals of mana form along the ground near ley lines within 1 mile of the lair. Creatures of mana, such as mana wyrms and arcane elementals, can manifest nearby.
- The dragon is assumed to have a body part of any creature within 1 mile of its lair for the purposes of scrying.
- Wisps of glittering energy float through the air and blue-glowing runes appear on surfaces within 1 mile of the dragon’s lair.

### Bronze Dragonflight
*"Unto you is charged the great task of keeping the purity of time. Know that there is only one true timeline, though there are those who would have it otherwise. You must protect it. Without the truth of time as it is meant to unfold, more will be lost than you can possibly imagine. The fabric of reality will unravel. It is a heavy task — the base of all tasks of this world, for nothing can transpire without time."*

<div style="text-align:Right">

— *Aman'Thul's blessing of the Bronze Aspect*

</div>

Adorned in scales of glimmering bronze, which often seem to shimmer like a mirage in the desert heat, bronze dragons are a majestic sight to behold. Massive wings blot out the sun, their eyes burn with magical intensity, and one has a sense of impending time in their presence. Encountering a bronze dragon is very rare, and always portends great events.

***Guardians of Time.*** Bronze dragons were gifted — and burdened — with power over the passage of time. They were able to see the past and the future with perfect clarity, and in so doing they could identify any unnatural branches from the established timeline. When great powers threatened to change the past to their benefit, or alter the course of events for a future that could be controlled, bronze dragons were there to thwart those plans. They performed their duty with diligence and honor for an Age, until Neltharion's betrayal of dragonkind.

***Hunted to All Corners.*** After Deathwing betrayed his own kind, he attempted to subjugate the bronze dragonflight. This would not come to pass, as Nozdormu — the Timeless One, Aspect of the bronze dragonflight — saw to it that his kin scattered to the distant corners of Azeroth. From there, they maintained their endless vigil over the proper timeline.

***War in the Desert.*** Though bronze dragons are not often likely to become involved in mortal affairs, they became embroiled in the War of the Shifting Sands, over a thousand years ago. Initially unwilling to help the night elves battle the Qiraji, their attitude changed when the spreading conflict threatened the Caverns of Time. Nozdormu and his kin joined in the fight, and even enlisted the aid of the other major dragonflights. After locking the danger away in Ahn'Qiraj, they returned to their seclusion.

***Destroying the Dragon Soul.*** They joined mortal affairs again during the Second War, specifically the Battle of Grim Batol. When faced with Deathwing and his minions once again, Nozdormo was finally convinced to throw the bronze dragonflight into the conflict. Along with the other dragons, they saw the destruction of the Dragon Soul which locked away some of the Aspects' power, and forced Deathwing into retreat once again. With Nozdormu restored to his former strength, he and the bronze dragons once again took a more active role in the world.

***Loss of the Sight.*** After the Cataclysm, when dragons gathered to battle Deathwing one final time, the bronze dragonflight was not absent. They took their place in Wyrmrest Accord and joined in the fight, but with the destruction of Deathwing and the fulfillment of the Aspects' purpose, much was lost. Nozdormu and the other bronze dragons retained much of their power, but lost their sight of the true timeline, as well as direct control over it.

### Bronze Dragon Lairs
[Bronze Dragonshrine, Caverns of Time.]

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- The dragon glimpses the future, so it has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until initiative count 20 on the next round.
- A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- The flow of time is altered such that every creature in the lair must reroll initiative. The dragon can choose not to reroll.

#### Regional Effects
The region containing a legendary bronze dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
- Within 3 miles of the dragon’s lair, shimmering mirages can be seen in the distance, showing reflections of other locations at other points in time, such as immense cities and primeval forests.
- Tracks of previous travellers through the region can occasionally be seen, as though they were freshly placed, regardless of how long ago their owners passed through. Other tracks disappear almost moments after being placed. Those that lead to the dragon’s lair are never to be found.
- Creatures within 6 miles of the lair regularly get a feeling of deja vu.

### Green Dragonflight

*"You are bound to the waking Dream of Creation. Nature is your realm, and all things have caught glimpses of the Emerald Dream when they sleep. You see them all, Ysera. And they see you, though they may not know it. Like the Life-Binder, you touch all living beings, and sing to them the songs of creation and interconnectedness."*

<div style="text-align:Right">

— *Eonar's blessing of the Green Aspect*

</div>

The green dragonflight consists of dragons adorned with vibrant, green scales -- earning them their second moniker as the *Emerald Dragonflight*. 

During the ordering of Azeroth, the titan Eonar charged Ysera and her flight with upholding the natural balance of both Azeroth and the Emerald Dream; a pristine spirit-realm of nature and magic that exists far beyond the boundaries of the physical world. It is through this charge that the green dragons keep their affinity for the wilds.

***Protectors of Nature.*** When dealing with mortals, green dragons primarily only come into conflict with those who would attempt to corrupt or destroy nature. In this sense, much like the red dragons, they are among the most approachable of the dragonflights. To this end, they have many a time sought the help of druids to aid in their task, and to this day keep a close connection with such groups -- the Cenarion Circle in particular.

***Solitary Lives.*** Given the task placed upon them and their ties to the Emerald Dream, it is not surprising that green dragons highly reclusive; exceedingly difficult for mere mortals to find on their own. They are peaceful, meditative, and said to be spending most of their time in slumber and quiet contemplation. 

\columnbreak

***Seeding the Great Trees.*** Following the Great Sundering at the end of the War of the Ancients, the green Dragon Aspect Ysera played part in seeding a colossal tree within the new Well of Eternity. The tree became known as Nordrassil, the Crown of the Heavens -- and with its branches as saplings, several more trees were scattered across Azeroth. 

These were the Great Trees, five of them in total. They were not planted with Ysera's approval, however, nor did they receive her blessing as Nordrassil once had. And so, as the trees came to tower over the lands, their roots dug deep, one tree fell an ill fate. In Northrend, the great tree Andrassil had reached deep enough into the earth to touch the subterranean prison of Yogg'saron. 

***The Seeping Nightmare.*** As Yogg'saron touched the roots of Andrassil, without the dragons' protection, corruption quickly seeped into the tree. Though it was a heartbreaking task for the druids of the Cenarion Circle, the tree was destroyed -- renamed Vordrassil, the Broken Crown -- and the corruption thought stopped. 

The Great Trees would all act as portals; each one an anchoring point for the druids and green dragons alike to travel between Azeroth and the Emerald Dream, as well as a grove under the dragonflight's protection. 

Unknown to them all, however, was the darkness that had already taken root within the Emerald Dream. Yogg'saron, and the other Old Gods with it, used the Great Trees to allow their influence to reach beyond the mortal world. Heralded by a corrupting mist that spread out across the land, and by its eponymous Nightmare Lord, swathes of the Dream were twisted beyond any resemblance of its verdant self and corrupted into a waking Nightmare.

### Green Dragon Lairs
[Green Dragonshrine, ???.]

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.
- One creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a dream plane, a different plane of existence the dragon has imagined into being. To escape, the creature must use its action to make a Charisma check contested by the dragon's. If the creature wins, it escapes the dream plane. Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count 20 on the next round. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied.
- The dragon creates fog as though it had cast the *fog cloud* spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.

#### Regional Effects
The region containing a legendary green dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
- The flora within 1 mile can sometimes come to life, turning into lashers and other similar creatures.
- When attempting to stay awake through a long rest, such as keeping watch, creatures within 3 miles of the dragon's lair must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw each hour or fall asleep.
- Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon's lair serve as the dragon's eyes and ears.
- The air within 3 miles of the dragon’s lair is misty and dim. Creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on sight for distances greater than 60 feet. When attempting to leave the area, this effect seems to fade.

### Red Dragonflight

*"This is my gift: compassion for all living things. A drive to protect and nurture them. And the ability to heal that which others cannot, birth what others may not, and love even the unlovable -- who surely need such grace more than any other souls."*

<div style="text-align:Right">

— *Eonar's blessing of the Green Aspect*

</div>

Borne across the sky on ruby wings, the red dragonflight are feared and revered for their fiery breath -- which has been gifted the power both to bring life and to take it away. They are led by Alexstrasza, the Life-Binder, whose duty was given to her by the titan Eonar. 

***Protectors of Life.*** It is not without reason that the red dragonflight consider themselves custodians of mortal life. In many ways, their claim is true; for they are often the chosen wardens of places and artifacts whose powers might spell doom for lesser beings. Wherever a red dragon walks or breathes upon the earth, its soil is renewed, lush and vibrant with life.

***Mortal Ambassadors.*** With the exception of the green dragonflight's ties to the druids of the Cenarion Circle, if a mortal were to encounter a dragon -- whether knowingly or not -- it's most likely that dragon would hail from the red dragonflight. It is common among all dragons to keep tabs on mortal races, especially their sprawling cities and important figures, none of the other flights would do so as openly as the red dragonflight often has.

***The Queen of Dragons.*** Perhaps even greater than her role as the Life-Binder, Alexstrasza of the red dragonflight also holds the title of Dragon Queen. She, along with her consorts, receives the greatest reverence even among the other dragonflights, and her compassion for the mortal races of Azeroth is beyond equal. 

It is her firmly held belief that only a few are ever truly evil, and that even those who are may not yet be beyond redemption. After all, the power to change and to grow is inherent in all life, whether it chooses to seek light or steep itself in darkness. 

***The Dragons and the Dragonmaw.*** During the Second War, the orc shaman Zuluhed of the Dragonmaw clan received visions of a powerful artifact hidden away within the depths of the earth -- the Dragon Soul. In the hands of Zuluhed's lieutenant, Nekros Skullcrusher, the Dragonmaw clan wielded the power of the Dragon Soul to track down and enslave scores of the red dragonflight; including the Life-Binder Alexstrasza herself.

For eight agonizing years, the Queen of Dragons was kept prisoner by the Dragonmaw clan, deep within the halls of Grim Batol; an ancient and abandoned dwarven fortress the orcs had seized as their base of operations. There, the orcish Horde raised her offspring as devastating weapons of war for their swelling ranks of dragon riders. 

***The Battle of Grim Batol.*** Even after the defeat of the Horde at the end of the Second War, the Dragonmaw clan remained undefeated at Grim Batol and Alexstrasza remained their prisoner. It was then that a small band of resistance fighters from the Alliance -- led by the human mage Rhonin -- managed to infiltrate the ancient fortress in an effort to free the Dragon Queen. 

A great battle ensued; one in which the Aspects clashed with the fallen Earth-Warder, before the Dragon Soul was shattered and the orcs routed. Once the dragons could take wing again, they returned to their old charge as protectors, though their wounds would take a long time to heal.

### Red Dragon Lairs
[Red Dragonshrine, ???.]

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Each creature of the dragon's choice within 60 feet of the dragon gains the benefits of the *haste* spell until initiative count 20. At the beginning of their turn, they take fire damage equal to their number of hit dice. This damage ignores fire resistance and immunity.

#### Regional Effects
The region containing a legendary red dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

### Lesser Dragonflights
Outside of the five greater dragonflights exists a number of outliers; all true dragons, with all the vast power and intellect that implies, but each of them outside of the charge of the Titans that has long empowered them.

These lesser dragonflights are all connected in some way to the five true flights, but each is distinct and unique in their own regard, eking out a place in the world that separates them from the true dragonflights. For better or worse, these lesser dragonflights are races unto themselves, and can be as if not more dangerous than the prime dragonflights.
 
#### Infinite Dragonflight
Appearing as invasive forces throughout the timeways as twisted inverses of the bronze dragonflight, the mysterious infinite dragonflight appear to their bronze foes as insane and extremely dangerous terrorists threatening the flows of history itself.

The infinite flight traverse history, appearing through hijacked timeways at important moments in history to disrupt and change the passage of time, seeking to avert some distant future that they consider unfavourable. Their origin is unknown, as are their motivations or base of operations; all that is known is that they are a threat to all of time, and the enemy to all life.

***The Infinite Aspect.*** Seemingly equal in power to the five true Dragon Aspects is the mysterious, unseen leader of the infinite flight. From a distant, broken, locked future timeline, this dragon of immense power directs the rest of their flight to influence past events with zealous fervour, as though desperate to change the future.
 
#### Netherwing Dragonflight
The netherwing dragonflight were born from black dragon eggs brought by Deathwing onto the orc homeworld Draenor -- shortly before it was destroyed. As the calamity tore the planet asunder, the volatile powers of the Twisting Nether saw the eggs hatch into shimmering, translucent beings; half there, half not.

Now fairly numerous, these world-weary dragons have lived hard lives since Outland's collapse, facing threats of enslavement or extinction at the hands of orcs and demons, before seeing their rapid lives burn out like too-bright stars in the dim sky. Like much else in Outland, they live lives of tragedy; nasty, brutish and short lives marred by the irony of their own creation, as dragons that were meant to be stockpiles of black eggs, and ended up being close to nothing at all.

They are wary of the world around them, and mistrusting of strangers, but the bonds they create with the few mortals they trust are eternal, and forged by dragonfire; for although they are composed of wild energy, dragons they are, and they are pleased to be recognized as such.

<div style='margin-top:30px;'></div>

#### Twilight Dragonflight
The culmination of years of study and experimentation by the consort to Deathwing, Sintharia, the twilight flight was crafted from the blood of all flights for one purpose alone; they are superweapons, vitriolic masses of unstable energy in dragon form that are able to release overwhelming power upon the foes of their masters, the black dragonflight. Their very existence is chaos, their bodies radiating the same twisted energies that saw their creation as they shift back and forth between the material world and a harrowing plane of existence known as the Realm of Twilight.

The greatest danger in encountering these creatures is their uncontrollable nature. Though they are loyal to Deathwing, they are prone to cowardice, outbursts and mockery when placed in the command of anyone else. This, combined with the extremely unstable nature of their bodies, makes being around one a dangerous risk even for allies. When they die, and even sometimes when they do not, their bodies are known to suddenly and violently explode with life-extinguishing energy, taking with them a sizeable chunk of the environment.

> ##### Chromatic Dragonflight
> One of Nefarion's earliest experiments was attempting to condense the powers of the five greater dragonflights into a single creation, to be known as the chromatic dragonflight. These experiments were largely considered failures; many whelps died before hatching, and those that survived were unstable, short-lived, volatile, and/or deformed. One of the very few successes of these experiments was the drakeadon, a semi-draconic beast.

### Infinite Dragonflight
*"The "End Time," I once called this place. I had not seen, by then; I did not know. You hope to... what? Stop me, here? Change the fate I worked so tirelessly to weave? You crawl unwitting, like a blind, writhing worm, towards endless madness and despair. I have witnessed the true End Time. This? This is a blessing you simply cannot comprehend."*

<div style="text-align:Right">

*- Murozond the Infinite*

</div>

The cruel and enigmatic Infinite Dragonflight are the inverse of the wise Bronze flight. Where the Bronze seek <br/> to maintain the flow of time and ensure that past events remain as they are, while trying to learn from their glimpses of the future, the Infinite flight seek to disrupt and change the course of history, appearing amongst major events from times past and altering them through trickery or brute force. Their motivations are cloudy, and their origins are a secret hidden in the ages past - or in the distant future.

***Negative Image.*** They appear as eye-watering negatives of their bronze foes, their colors and bodies altered by their drastic meddling with the timeflow, with scales in metallic greys and blues. Their hides appear cracked and bleed out glowing energy instead of blood. Their voices almost seem to come from all directions, and echo in a disjointed manner, and when they move they almost seem to be unsynchronised with events around them - their shadows may lag behind for a moment, or their breath attack may scorch the earth before the flames touch it.

***Time Bandits.***  The Infinites have only one apparent <br/> goal - changing the outcomes of major historical events to change the future. To do so they aggressively create tears in time, before using disguise and  subterfuge to subtly change events. They may mislead a major leader, assassinate a king, or simply change several minor details and invoke the butterfly effect. When things do not go according to plan, however, they throw subtlety away and engage in all-out dragon combat, uncaring of the consequences across time.

***Ebb and flow.*** In response to these threats, the Bronze Dragonflight have been in a constant state of cat and mouse with the Infinites. Never able to identify their base of operations, with only smatterings of knowledge about their leadership, the Bronze have found that they are unable to do direct interference with the Infinites - partly due to their own nature, but also because the Infinites seem to know everything about the Bronze. Their methods, their weaknesses, their powers - and the Infinites are far less scrupulous with collateral damage. As such, the Bronze must frequently collaborate with adventurers, sending them into the past through the Caverns of Time to prevent catastrophic destruction to the timeline.

***Lost time.*** The origins of the Infinites are unclear. However, among their ranks, some familiar names have been heard. It has been suggested that the Infinites may have once been Bronze dragons who became disillusioned with the duty of their flight, or perhaps who entered the timeways and became lost or confused. Others suggest that the Infinites may be dark reflections of real dragons created from alternative universes, of which thousands are created and destroyed each second. In truth, their origins may remain a mystery as old as time.

> ***Multiattack.*** The wyrm can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claw.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) fire damage.
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.
>
> ***Tail Sweep.*** The wyrm swings its tail, and every creature within 20 feet of it must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.
>
> ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the wyrm's choice that is within 120 feet of the wyrm and aware of it must succeed on a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the wyrm's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
>
> ***Black Sand Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The wyrm exhales sand in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 148 (33d8) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This damage ignores resistance to slashing damage and treats immunity as resistance instead. 
> <br/>   Until the beginning of the drake's next turn, a creature who fails their save has their speed halved, can't make more than one attack on its turn, and can use an action or bonus action but not both.
>
> ***Change Shape.*** The wyrm magically transforms into any humanoid that is Medium or Small, while retaining its game statistics (other than its size). This transformation ends if the dragon is reduced to 0 hit points or uses a bonus action to end it.
>
> ### Legendary Actions
> The wyrm can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The wyrm regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
>
> **Temporal Flicker.** The wyrm teleports to an 
<br/>    unoccupied space it can see within 40 feet.
> <br/> **Glimpse the Future.** The wyrm has advantage on its 
<br/>    next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.
> <br/> **Reverse Time (Costs 2 Actions).** A creature within 
<br/>    80 feet that the wyrm can see must make a DC 23 
<br/>    Charisma save. On a failure, they are teleported to 
<br/>    the space where they were in the start of their turn. 
<br/>    In addition, they have disadvantage in their next 
<br/>    attack.
> <br/> **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The wyrm beats its 
<br/>    wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the wyrm 
<br/>    must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or 
<br/>    take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be 
<br/>    knocked prone. The wyrm can then fly up to half its 
<br/>    flying speed.
> <br/> **Breath Weapon (Costs 3 Actions).** The wyrm uses its 
<br/>    breath weapon, if it is available.

### Infinite Dragon Lairs
[Bronze lairs are infinite lairs.]

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- The effects of time are altered such that every creature in the lair must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become 1d20 years older or younger (the dragon's choice), but never any younger than 1 year old. A *greater restoration* spell can restore a creature's age to normal.
- Each creature within 30 feet of the dragon must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be affected by corrupted time, rolling 1d4 times on the Corrupted Time table below.

##### Corrupted Time
d6| Result
--|------
1 | **Rewind Time.** The target regains hit points equal to its total number of hit dice.
2 | **Time Lapse.** On its next turn, the target's speed is halved and cannot use its action.
3 | **Temporal Daze.** On its next turn, the target cannot take any action or bonus action and uses all of its movement to move in a random direction. 
4 | **Temporal Shift.** The target teleports to a random position within 30 feet.
5 | **Time Warp.** Until the drake's next turn, the target's speed is doubled, attacks against it have advantage and it cannot maintain concentration.
6 | **Unravel Time.** The target takes psychic damage equal to its total number of hit dice.

#### Regional Effects
The region containing a legendary bronze dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
- Within 3 miles of the dragon’s lair, shimmering mirages can be seen in the distance, showing reflections of other locations at other points in time, such as immense cities and primeval forests.
- Tracks of previous travellers through the region can occasionally be seen, as though they were freshly placed, regardless of how long ago their owners passed through. Other tracks disappear almost moments after being placed. Those that lead to the dragon’s lair are never to be found.
- Creatures within 6 miles of the lair regularly get a feeling of deja vu.

### Netherwing Dragonflight

*"You were once a chief lieutenant, Mor'ghor. Your work in Grim Batol is not easily forgotten. Now... We need the eggs that you recovered. The Netherwing eggs. They are, after all, a product of the master. We will pay whatever price that you ask."*

<div style="text-align:Right">

*- Sintharia*

</div>

The Netherwing Dragonflight live in the shadow of many sordid events. Spawned of the Black Dragonflight as eggs laid by Deathwing's own consort, they were cursed before they even hatched when they were hidden by their father on Draenor - shortly before the orc homeworld's destruction. As a result of the twisting shadowy energy upon their embryonic bodies, upon hatching they were found to be a new creature entirely; one that exists in a state of unreality, half there and half not.

Deep purples, blues and greens - the colours of the  Twisting Nether - emblazon Netherwing populations, their translucent bodies and shadowy skin seeming smooth and flush. Their faces are more like that of a shark than a reptile. They are of few words, what little they say tends to be sombre. 

Living in the nether-torn reaches of Outland, the Netherwing Flight have propagated and forged a life for themselves, facing off threats at every angle, from slavery to extinction, while being forced to accept the facts of their own half-existence.

***Nether born.*** Hatched in the swirling energies of a dying planet, the Netherwing dragons can be said to be only half-real. Creatures fighting them may find that their attacks simply phase through the dragons' bodies. Their very presence will burn away at the very being of anybody unfortunate enough to be near them, and their very breath is formed of the arcane energies of the Twisting Nether. Due to the instability of their bodies, they grow into adult hood rapidly, and then burn their lives away at extreme speed, fading away like dying stars. 

***Dragonmaw mounts.*** The remnants of the unscrupulous Dragonmaw Claon in Outland have a history of capturing, enslaving and breaking dragons into beasts of war, and as the only dragons native to Outland, the Netherwing are no different. Bound in the name of Illidan Stormrage, the dragons faced a choice of enslavement or death. 

***Dark energies.*** The magic within their bodies and their eggs is considered valuable by those interested in such things, and the devious methods that utilise this magic never result in a living Nether dragon. The corruptive power within their unstable bodies has been seen to alter and transform those flooded with it, while their eggs have been used as a stepping stone in the creation of even darker species.

> 
> **Decrepify.** A creature within 60 feet that the wyrm can 
<br/>    see must make a DC 23 Dexterity save. On a failure, 
<br/>    their movement speed is reduced to 0 feet until the 
<br/>    end of the wyrm's next turn.
> <br/> **Drain Energy.** The wyrm drains the ambient energy 
<br/>    around it, regaining a use of Intangible Presence.

<br/>    of the wyrm must make a DC 15 Constitution 
<br/>    saving throw or lose the spell.

<br/>    30 feet of the dragon who took damage from its 
<br/>    Nether Burn Aura or Nether Breath since the 
<br/>    beginning of its last turn must make a DC 23
<br/>    Constitution save, taking 14 (4d6) necrotic damage 
<br/>    on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. 
<br/>    The dragon regains hit points equal to the necrotic 
<br/>    damage dealt.
> <br/> **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The wyrm beats its 
<br/>    wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the wyrm 
<br/>    must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or 
<br/>    take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be 
<br/>    knocked prone. The wyrm can then fly up to half its 
<br/>    flying speed.
> <br/> **Breath Weapon (Costs 3 Actions).** The wyrm uses its 
<br/>    breath weapon, if it is available.

### Twilight Dragonflight

*"I am the beginning of the end...the shadow which blots out the sun...the bell which tolls your doom. For this moment ALONE was I made. Look upon your death, mortals, and despair!"* 

<div style="text-align:Right">

*- Ultraxion*

</div>

Into the Twilight Dragonflight, the black dragon Aspect Deathwing placed all of his hatred and seething desire to see life put to an end. Into their bodies he placed the atrophic power of pure destruction, the power sufficient to end all life. Into their minds he placed only anger and jealousy, mixed with pride enough to eclipse any other. In the Twilight flight Deathwing had his perfect weapons.

Their deep purple bodies, at times semi-translucent, pulse and hum with overwhelming amounts of energy. Their extremely unstable forms fluctuate, and their mere presence warps and alters magic around them.  Though physically powerful, their true strength is in their powers over their twilight magic, able to tap into a mysterious Twilight Realm to facilitate their unmaking of their master's foes.

***Experiments Completed.*** Through his children and mate's failed work creating the Netherwing and Chromatic dragons, Deathwing saw the path to success in his grand plan - a race of dragonkin subservient to him that exist only to destroy. A symbol of his future dominion over dragonkind, and weapon to bring it to fruition. To Deathwing, his family's failures made them less than nothing - the Twilight Flight was his success, and his alone.

***Unstable Horrors.*** Twilight dragons are extremely unstable, being flooded with considerably more energy than their bodies can handle. It is common for weakened Twilight dragons to spontaneously explode, causing significant destruction even in death. Even when intact, their bodies constantly arc out with devastating energy, which can ground itself on unfortunate adventurers unfortunate enough to act as a conduit. 

***Twilight Realm.*** The dragons of this flight are able to tap into, and even transport themselves to, a mysterious place they call the Twilight Realm. Nothing is known of this place other than that no light enters it. There is no sun in the sky, no flames to light the way, and no hope for any mortal trapped within.

***Displaced loyalty.*** The twilight dragons are fully and exclusively loyal to Deathwing, and when made to ally themselves with others of Deathwing's servants, they make clear their distaste in no small amount. It is rare that a grown twilight dragon of any renown would ever consider dying to save another, unless expected to by Deathwing himself.
