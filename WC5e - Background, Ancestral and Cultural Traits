# Character Origins
This chapter describes the three components of an adventurer's origin: ancestry, culture, and background. Together, these elements suggest your character's early experience and family origin before taking up the adventuring life and learning the capabilities of a class (described in chapter ###).

## Origin Components
Each part of your character's origin reflects facets of your character, their life, and the circumstances that started them on the path to adventure.

Each component reflects a part of your character's life: the race or species that they were born as, the culture that shaped them into the person they grew up to be, and the position they held within that society that taught them the skills they needed to succeed.

As no two people are the same, neither are any two origins. You can choose freely from each list of Ancestry, Culture, and Background. Examples include a "traditional" origin such as Arthas Menethil, a Human from the human kingdom of Lordaeron, where he is known as a Noble prince. Or alternatively, an unusual origin such Thrall, an Orc raised among the Lordaeron culture as a Gladiator.

### Choosing your Ancestry
When you choose your character's ancestry, you determine whether your character is a human or a member of a fantastical species, such as an elf, orc, or gnome.

An ancestry determines many of the physiological aspects of your character. For example, orcs are naturally muscle-bound creatures, elves and draenei have an inherent talent for magic, and tauren are immense cow-like creatures with wide horns. These attributes provide certain benefits shared with all others of their species. 

#### Parts of an Ancestry
An ancestry includes the following parts.

***Age.*** Members of most species live for about 80 years, with exceptions noted in the text about the species in this chapter. Regardless of life span, members of all species reach physical maturity at about the same age. Your character can be any age that isn't beyond their species' normal life span.

***Creature Type.*** A character's ancestry determines the character's creature type, which is described in the Rules Glossary. Most species in this chapter are Humanoid.

***Size.*** Your character’s ancestry determines the character's size. Individuals within an ancestry cover a wide range of heights, and some species include such diversity of size that you can choose whether your character is Small or Medium.

***Speed.*** Your character’s ancestry determines the character’s Speed.

***Special Traits.*** Each ancestry gives a character special traits - unique characteristics based on the ancestry's physiology or magical nature. When you choose an ancestry, your character gets all the special traits listed for it. Some traits involve making a choice from a handful of options.

### Choosing your Culture
A character’s culture is often determined by regional or social norms. Things like the languages you speak, the knowledge you value, or the habits you’ve developed are often part of your cultural upbringing. A character with Dalaran culture might put a lot of value in studying history or magic and would take pride in their ability to speak many languages. Your culture gives your character Cultural Traits, which are typically learned skills and talents.

#### Parts of a Culture
A culture includes some special traits, determined by the upbringing that primarily shaped your character. When you choose a culture, your character gets all the special traits listed for it. Some traits involve making a choice from a handful of options.

### Subancestries and Subcultures
Some Heritages have subancestries, such as Trolls or Elves, who have been known to have members with significantly different physiology. Heritages can also have Subcultures, areas where these groups of people have differing or specific beliefs or values from their larger culture.

### Character Backgrounds
Your character's background is a collection of characteristics that represent the place and occupation that were most formative before your character embarked on a life of adventure.

Each background includes a brief narrative of what your character’s past might have been like. Alter the details of this narrative however you like.

#### Parts of a Background
A background includes the following parts.

***Ability Scores.*** A background lists three of your character’s ability scores. Increase one by 2 and another one by 1, or increase all three by 1. None of these increases can raise a score above 20.

***Feat.*** A background gives your character a specified Origin feat (described in chapter 5).

***Skill Proficiencies.*** A background gives your character proficiency in two specified skills.

***Tool Proficiency.*** Each background gives a character proficiency with one tool—either a specific tool or one chosen from the Artisan’s Tools category.

***Equipment.*** Each background offers a choice between a package of equipment and 50 GP.

## Human
Human kingdoms have existed for thousand of years, and humans themselves for thousands more. Their short lives in comparison to dwarves and elves pushes them to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Their valor, optimism, and stubbornness have led them to build some of the greatest kingdoms on Azeroth, some of which still stand a millennium later. Whatever have pushed them down, it has only strengthened the bond between those that still stand.

### Human Ancestral Traits
Your Human character has certain characteristics in common with other Humans.

***Size.*** Humans range from 5 to 6 feet tall, and vary in build. Your size is Medium. To set your height and weight randomly, start with rolling the size modifier:
<div style="margin-top: -18px; font-family: ScalySans, sans-serif">

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Size Modifier:*** 2d8
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Height:*** 5 feet + 2 inches + your size modifier in inches
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Weight in Pounds:*** 120 + (2d4 x your size modifier)
</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 

***Determination.*** When you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can do so with advantage. You can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Human Spirit.*** When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die. You must use the new result, even if it is a 1.

### Human Cultural Traits

***Subculture.*** There are seven main subcultures among humans in modern times, tied to the seven kingdoms that existed at the time of the Dark Portal's opening: Alterac, Dalaran, Gilneas, Kul Tiras, Lordaeron, Stormwind, and Stromgarde. Choose one of these subcultures.

#### Alterac
Found in the Alterac mountains, **Alteracis** are of moderate height and muscular built, with skin hues of pale and fair skin. Their hair is usually silver or blonde, and their eye color varies widely, though light colorations are common.  [MORE LORE ABOUT KINGDOM.]

***TRAITS TBD.***

#### Dalaran
**Dalaranians** are slender, fair-skinned folk with brown hair that ranges from blond to almost black. Most are of moderate height and have blue or green eyes. But these traits are hardly universal. Humans of Dalaran come from far and wide across the Eastern Kingdoms to study or seek refuge within the floating city. [MORE LORE ABOUT KINGDOM.]

***Sorcerer's Appentice.*** You know one cantrip of your choice from the mage spell list. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell when you cast it with this trait (choose when you select this race).

***Student of the Kirin Tor.*** You have proficiency in your choice of either the Arcana or History skills.

#### Gilneas
**Gilneans** are tall, fair to amber-skinned folk with blue or steely gray eyes. Most have hair ranging from wine-red or light brown to raven-black.  [MORE LORE ABOUT KINGDOM.]

***TRAITS TBD.***

#### Kul Tiras
Native to the Kul Tiran isles, **Kul Tirans** are generally tall and muscular, with fair to amber skin similar to that of gilneans, brown to black hair, and light colored eyes. [MORE LORE ABOUT KINGDOM.]

***Child of the Sea.*** Kul Tirans spend so much time near and on the water that they practically become semi-aquatic. Your character has a swim speed equal to your movement speed and can hold your breath for up to 15 minutes at a time.

#### Lordaeron
Widespread along the Eastern Kingdoms northern realm, **Lordaeronians** are of medium height and slender built, with pale skin. Their hair and eye color varies widely, but silver or light colored hair and blue eyes are common. [MORE LORE ABOUT KINGDOM.]

***Call to Arms.*** You have proficiency in light armor and shields, as well as the longsword, shortbow, and spear.

***Sunday School.*** You have proficiency in your choice of either the History or Religion skill.

#### Stormwind
Found within the southern region of the Eastern King-doms, **Stormwindians** are of moderate height and build, with skin hues ranging from tawny to fair. Their hair varies widely from blonde to brown, as does their eyes, though brown is most common.  [MORE LORE ABOUT KINGDOM.]

***TRAITS TBD.***

#### Stromgarde
Shorter in build than most other humans, **Stromics** have generally pale skin contrasted by brown or black hair, and dark colored eyes.  [MORE LORE ABOUT KINGDOM.]

***TRAITS TBD.***

Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven biology.

***Age.*** Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.

***Size.*** Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.

***Low-Light Vision.*** Accustomed to life underground, you are able to better see in low-light conditions. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light.

Dwarven Hardiness. You have advantage on Constitution ability checks and saving throws made against nonmagical hazards and effects, such as extreme hot and cold, a forced march on no sleep, or downing several gallons of ale.

Sure-Footed. You have advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws to avoid being forcibly moved (such as through a bull rush) or knocked prone, so long as your feet are firmly planted on the ground (not when you are climbing, riding, flying, etc.).

Dwarven Resilience. You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage, most likely a feature of you ancestors’ diet.

Dwarven Toughness. Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level, due in large part to the long history of difficult labor required to survive underground for generations.
