## Death Knight
*A hero... that's what you once were. You stood against the shadow, and purchased another dawn for this world at the cost of your life. But the evil you fought is not so easily banished, the victory you claimed not so easily held. The specter of death looms over this world again, it has found new champions to bring about its final reign. Knights of darkness, this is the hour of your dark rebirth . . .*

<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— A knight of the Ebon Blade*  </div>

A human clad in heavy armor, wielding a greatsword with both hands, as he clutches it close, runes flash along its edge, leaving a stream of black smoke behind his swings.

An orc surrounded by kobolds, forces his axe into the ground as the earth around him wither and die, frightening the kobolds as they run for their life.

Biting cold rushes through the battle, as a lone blood elf walks forward, her armor clad in a layer of frost, she walks with firm steps, freezing the earth beneath her feet.

No matter their past calling, death knights serve the powers of death, wielding weapons infused with runes of power. They are ruthless and practical warriors resurrected by the powerful val'kyrs and granted the powers of the revered death knights of the Ebon Hold. Although these warriors seem dead at a glance, they are very much alive.

### Outcast for Life
Although these death knights are not undead as the genera-tions before them, they carry much of the essence of the knights that came before them, and from a distance have the look of a dead person, their blank white stares peering at the world around them. Even though they are alive and not emotionless, it means little to most they meet who shun them because of what they have become. Death knights are bringers of death and destroy, a fact not easily forgotten.

This has lead most death knights down a solitary path, many keep to the outskirts of towns and cities, or hide their appearance well before entering.

### Grim Revival
Being resurrected as a death knight is not a simple task, only complicated further by the scar it leaves on the newly resurrected, gaining the powers of the death knights weak-ens the soul for a tremendous time, a price that has to be paid. But not only does it drain the death knight, some scars are visible for all to see, their resurrection has filled their body with necrotic energy that will forever linger with-in them, a trait always shown through their eyes, which will forever sit as two white lights in their sockets.

### Steadfast Warriors
Death knights are exceptional warriors, and in many ways similar to paladins, being keen with various weapons and able to fight in any armor, aiding their combat with the use of magic. They wield their empowered runic weapons and shadow magic which enables them to overpower most foes that would dare to stand against them, making them fearful fighters able to stand in any situation.

### Dark Rebirth

In order to become a death knight, you have to have died and been resurrected. The touch of the grave lingers, granting you the following traits:

- You have two creature types: humanoid and undead. You can be affected by a game effect if it works on either of your creature types.
- You don't require food, water, or air.
- You don't need to sleep. Instead, you can enter a semiconscious state where you feed your eternal hunger by reminiscing on agony you have caused. After doing so for 4 hours, you receive the same benefit as a human does from eight hours of sleep.
- You do not age, and will live forever unless destroyed.
- You have advantage on any saving throws versus disease.
- You have advantage on saves versus any effect that turns or affects undead.
 
At your option, you can pick from or roll on the Death Knight Quirks table to create a quirk for your character.

\pagebreakNum

##### Death Knight Quirks
d6| Quirk
--|--
1|You are always icy cold to the touch.
2|When you are still, you sometimes forget to breathe and others think you dead.
3|You barely bleed, even when badly injured.
4|Your heart beats once per minute. This event sometimes surprises you.
5|You have trouble remembering that living creatures and corpses should be treated differently.
6|You blinked. Once. Last week.

> #### Variant: Dark Pact
> Being an undead creature comes with both benefits and drawbacks. As an undead, you can be adversely affected by certain spells and abilities such as a paladin's smite evil or a number of priest spells. Those who are unaware of these difficulties or are unwilling to deal with the may replace their Dark Rebirth class feature with **Dark Pact**. 
>
> Instead of being a creature who was killed and reanimated as a death knight, you sought out the power of the death knight class while still alive. You learned to bind your soul to the power of a runeblade, becoming closer to the nature of undeath and gaining the following benefits instead:
>
> - Your death knight spells and abilities treat you as if you were undead as well as humanoid.
> - Spells and abilities that detect undead treat you as such.
> - You can hold your breath for up to 1 hour at a time, and you only need half as much food and water to survive.
> - You don't need to sleep. Instead, you can enter a semiconscious state where you feed your eternal hunger by reminiscing on agony you have caused. After doing so for 4 hours, you receive the same benefit as a human does from eight hours of sleep.
> - For every 10 years that pass, you only age 1 year.
> - You have advantage on any saving throws versus disease.

> ##### Death Knights and the Forsaken
> The Forsaken, being already dead, gain little benefit from either the Dark Rebirth or Dark Pact class features. Undeath does not stack with itself, after all.
> 
> Forsaken Death Knights instead no longer need to sleep at all, filling their long rests with no more than light activity. They do not need to breathe and have advantage on saving throws versus disease.

\columnbreak

### Runeblade

You learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon, turning it into your runeblade. You perform the ritual over the course of a long rest, carving mystic runes into the weapon's surface. Your bond with your runeblade grants you the following abilities:

- You can't be disarmed of your runeblade unless you are incapacitated. 
- If your runeblade is on the same plane of existence, you can summon it as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.
- Your runeblade counts as a magic weapon for damage resistance.

You can transfer your bond to another weapon, even one with existing magic abilities, as part of a long rest. Doing so severs the bond between you and your existing runeblade, causing the runes in that weapon to fade away.

### Runic Power

Your bond with your runeblade fills you with a well of power, which refills on a long rest. You have an amount of runic power points equal to 5 x your death knight level. At 1st level, you can use this pool to cast a **Death Coil** or to make a **Rune Strike**. You learn additional abilities as you level up.

***Death Coil.*** You draw from your pool, launching a black-green bolt of necrotic energy at a target within 120 feet. As an action, make a spell attack roll, using your Charisma modifier. On a hit, the target takes necrotic damage equal to twice the number of runic power points spent this way. 

If the target is an undead under your control, the attack roll automatically succeeds and the target is healed a number of hit points equal to the number of runic power points spent.

***Rune Strike.*** When you hit a creature and deal damage, you can spend a number of points from your pool of runic power to deal extra damage. You can spend no more than your death knight level in runic power points per hit with this ability. 

\pagebreakNum

### Fighting Style

At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Dark Warrior (UA)
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. They count as death knight spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the warlock spell list.

#### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### Mounted Warrior (New!)
When fighting while mounted, your melee attacks against targets that are the same size or smaller than your mount have a +1 bonus to attack rolls. Additionally, you have advantage on saves to avoid being forcibly dismounted.

### Runeforging

In your study of dark magic, you have learned how to harness the power of runes of blood, frost, and unholy magic. You inscribe a number of runes onto your runeblade, enabling you to use Rune Magic and to utilize other effects. 

Starting at 2nd level, you gain access to a number of Runic Empowerments, as detailed at the end of the class description. You know all Runic Empowerments for which you meet the prerequisites, but can only have one active at any given time. You can change which runic empowerment is currently active when you finish a long rest. 

### Rune Magic

Beginning at 2nd level, you have learned to draw out the power in the runes emblazoned on your runeblade, expending their power to fuel spells.

#### Spell Slots

The Death Knight table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your death knight spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell Death Coil, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
At 2nt level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the death knight spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Death Knight table shows when you learn more death knight spells of your choice of 1st level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new death knight spell, which can be 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the death knight spells you know and replace it with another spell from the death knight spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

___
- **Spell save DC =** 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
- **Spell attack modifier =** your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
___

#### Spellcasting Focus
You **must** use your runeblade as your spellcasting focus for your death knight spells.

### Presence

By 3rd level, you have shown a talent for one of the schools of dark arts used by death knights. Up until this time you have been building your dark power and are now ready to unleash the powers of your specialty upon the weak. Now you choose the Blood Presence, Frost Presence, or Unholy Presence, all detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 7th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include presence spells and Runic Power abilities.

#### Presence Spells

Each presence has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the presence description. Once you gain access to the spell, you add them to the death knight spell list.

#### Channel Power

You've learned to channel the power of your chosen presence, fueling magic abilities. Each Channel Power option provided by your Presence explains how to use it.

When you use your Channel Power, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Power again.

Some of your Channel Power effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your death knight spell save DC.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

\pagebreakNum

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Enhanced Runeforging

By 11th level, you gain the ability to have two runic empowerments active at once, instead of one. You can choose to replace one or both as part of a long rest. You cannot choose the same ability twice.

### Anti-Magic Shell

Beginning on 14th level, your dark power disrupts incoming magic. You have advantage on saving throws versus spells and have resistance on damage from spells.

## Presences

### Presence of Blood

<img src='https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/c/c0/Blood_Strike_TCG.jpg?version=8cbd020ca15be31c11337333aad05943' style='width:320px;' />

__

In undeath, some death knights find a special affinity for the blood and bone of the living. They carve into their enemies, sustaining themselves with deadly sanguine strikes, while using the bloody, shattered remains of the dead to fortify their own defenses. These crimson-soaked knights bend the very rules of mortality to control the frontlines of the battlefield.

#### Presence Spells
You gain presence spells at the death knight levels listed.

 Death Knight Level | Spells
--------------------|-------
3rd                 | ✦ Analyze Blood, ✦ Bone Shard
5th                 | ✦ Blood Bath, ✦ Blood Boil
9th                 | ✦ Blood Parasite, Vampiric Touch
13th                | ✦ Blood Puppet, Stoneskin
17th                | ✦ Dancing Rune Weapon, ✦ Mass Compelled Duel

✦ = New Spell detailed in the appendix

\columnbreak

#### Blood Shield
Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to turn shed blood into a shield from harm. Whenever you deal damage with a melee attack, you can spend a number of runic power points (up to the amount of damage dealt by the attack) to heal yourself for an amount of hit points equal to twice the amount of damage you dealt. If this healing would bring your health above your max hit point total, you gain the excess as temporary hit points. 

Unlike normal temporary hit points, the temporary hit points you gain from this method can stack with themselves, to a maximum of twice your death knight level.

#### Channel Power
When you gain this presence at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Power options. 

***Blood Strike.*** 
You can deal grevious damage to an opponent, draining their life to restore your own. When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend a use of Channel Power to deal extra necrotic damage to your opponent, restoring lost hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt. The amount of damage is equal to your death knight level plus your Charisma modifier.

If the healing gained from this ability would bring your hit point above your hit point maximum, you gain the excess as temporary hit points. These stack with any hit points granted by Blood Shield, and cannot exceed twice your death knight level.

***Bone Shield.*** 
When a creature within reach of you drops to 0 hit points, as a reaction you can expend a use of Channel Power to rip out bits of flesh and bone from their corpse, causing them to whirl around you in a protective shield. You gain one charge of Bone Shield for every Hit Die of the target corpse. 

For the next hour, as long as you have at least one charge of Bone Shield remaining, you have a +1 bonus to Armor Class and saving throws and resistance to all damage. Each time you fail a saving throw or take damage from an attack, you lose one charge of Bone Shield.

#### Power of the Grave
Starting at 6th level, you have resistance to poison damage and advantage on saves versus the poisoned condition. If you are wearing heavy armor, your Armor Class increases by 1.

#### Aura of Blood
Starting at 7th level, you are surrounded by an aura of deathly decay. Whenever you, or any allies within 10 feet of you, deal damage with a melee weapon to a creature, heal a number of hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). A creature can benefit from this feature from only one death knight at a time.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

#### Red Thirst
Upon reaching 10th level, you wade into armies of foes, great swings of your weapon striking any who threaten you. When you make a weapon attack while raging, you can make another attack as a bonus action with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.

\pagebreakNum

#### Will of the Necropolis
Starting at 15th level, you have resistance to all damage when your hit points (including temporary hit points) are less than half of your maximum hit points, rounded down.

#### Bone Storm
At 20th level, you gain the ability to unleash a whirlwind of bone and blood in a 30 foot sphere centered on yourself. You gain half your death knight level, rounded down, in Bone Shield charges. These stack with any existing Bone Shield charges. 

All creatures in the area of effect take magical piercing damage when you activate this ability and when they begin or end their turn within range. Thea mount of damage is based on the number of charges of Bone Shield you currently possess, as well as how close they are to you, as indicated on the Bone Storm Damage table. They may take a Dexterity save for half damage, using your death knight spell save DC.

Bone Storm lasts for 1 minute or until you have no charges of Bone Shield remaining. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

##### Bone Storm Damage

Distance from Caster|Damage
---|---
10 ft. away or closer|4 x the number of charges
11 to 20 ft. away|3 x the number of charges
21 to 30 ft. away|2 x the number of charges


### Presence of Frost

<img src='https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/d/d9/BloodChill.jpg?version=a89cff7f85890f87586cc0cd1cb2e611' style='width:320px' />

__

Combining martial prowess with supernatural cold, frost death knights leave their enemies chilled to the bone and broken of the will to fight. Unlike mages who learn to harness frost magic to great effect, these death knights are born of it, rime gripping their decaying hearts. These frozen undead warriors wield dual blades to strike with ferocity and inflict deathly cold upon anyone who would stand against them.

\columnbreak
#### Presence Spells
You gain presence spells at the paladin levels listed.

 Death Knight Level | Spells
--------------------|-------
3rd                 | Armor of Agathys, Zephyr Strike
5th                 | Gust of Wind, Warding Wind
9th                 | ✦✦ Blizzard, Elemental Weapon
13th                | ✦✦ Freezing Touch, ✦✦ Ice Block
17th                | Cone of Cold, Steel Wind Strike

✦✦ = Spell detailed in the Warcraft Hero's Handbook

#### Dual Wielder
When you gain this presence at 3rd level, you gain the ability to have two runeblades at a time, provided both are melee weapons that lack the two-handed property. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon or with a second weapon with the two-handed property, you must break one of your bonds. 

Both weapons receive the benefits of being your runeblade, including any runic empowerments, and can summon both runeblades with your bonus action.

#### Runic Empowerment
When you gain this presence at 3rd level, you gain the ability to use your power to rapidly against your foes. Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 5 runic power points to make two melee attacks with your runeblades as a bonus action. If you are two-weapon fighting, you attack once with each weapon.

#### Channel Power
When you gain this presence at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Power options.

***Killing Machine.*** You can use your Channel Power as a bonus action to guide your attacks: for 1 minute, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

***Obliterate.*** You can use your Channel Power to strike with supernatural accuracy. When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel Power to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.

#### Might of the Frozen Wastes
Starting at 6th level, you have resistance to cold damage. Additionally, you ignore difficult terrain caused by ice and snow. You can tolerate temperatures as low as -100 degrees Fahrenheit (-73.3 Celsius).

#### Aura of Frost
Starting at 7th level, you let out an aura of deathly chill. Enemy creatures within 10 feet of you have their movement speed reduced by 5 feet for every point of your Charisma modifier (minimum 5 foot reduction in speed).

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

#### Inexorable Assault
10th level, your melee weapon attacks deal a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

\pagebreakNum

#### Frozen Heart
At 15th level, you gain immunity to cold damage. In addition, any spell or effect you create ignores resistance to cold damage and treats immunity to cold damage as resistance to cold damage.

#### Howling Blast
At 20th level, you gain the ability to let out a swirling blast of frozen Northrend winds as an action in a 20-ft sphere centered on you. The area in this sphere is heavily obscured and the area is considered difficult terrain. You are not blinded or damaged by this ability, nor are you slowed by the difficult terrain.

When you activate this ability, all creatures in the area of effect must make a Dexterity save versus your death knight spell save DC. Failure means that they take 6d8 points of cold damage and fall prone, success means that they take only half damage.

### Presence of the Unholy

<img src='https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/2/20/Zog%2C_Herald_of_Death.jpg?version=f25515645a76b56b911309d932e576e6' style='width:325px;' />

__

While free from the Lich King’s grasp, some death knights still embody the ever-corrupting nature of the Scourge plague that once threatened to consume Azeroth. No matter their allegiance or cause, they remain defilers of life; and nowhere is their callousness more on display than when threatened. Inflictors of the most aggressive of diseases—and masters of raising unhallowed minions from the ground—these unholy death knights are vicious melee combatants, capable of striking with the force of an undead legion and unleashing pestilence that would bring their foes to ruin.

✦ = New spell described in the appendix

### Ebon Plaguebringer
When you gain this presence at 3rd level, you forge a greater connection between yourself and the forces of death and disease. When a creature you can see moves into a space within 10 feet of you or starts its turn there, you can use your reaction to deal 1d4 necrotic damage to that creature unless it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The necrotic damage increases to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level. 

Additionally, you have resistance to necrotic damage and are immune to diseases.

### Risen Ally
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to create a minor undead to serve as your servant. At the end of a long rest, you can use random bits of bone and flesh to create a lesser ghoul. The stats for this creature is laid out in the Appendix. You can only have one creature created by Risen Ally at a time; attempting to create a second creature results in the previous one collapsing into a heap of bones.

### Master of the Undead
When you gain this presence at 3rd level, you have learned to create a connection to the dead, boosting their power in return for servitude. You can form a bond with an undead creature, granting it the **Might of the Master** ability. The max CR of the undead depends on your level, as stated in the Max Undead CR table.

Death Knight Level|Max CR
---|---
3rd|1/2
8th|1
13th|2
18th|3

If the bonded undead dies, you can use your runic power to revive them provided they are within 60 feet of you. They are restored to life with twice the amount of hit points as the number of runic power you spent to revive them, up to their normal maximum hit points. 

They also can be restored to unlife at the end of a short rest, coming back with 1 hit point. You can expend hit dice during a short rest to heal your bonded undead instead of yourself, healing them the number rolled. The undead is restored to full hit points after a long rest. 

If your bonded undead is one you gained control of through means such as the Control Undead Channel Power ability, or one created by a spell such as animate dead, you must still reassert control as normal, though they make their save with disadvantage. If you fail to reassert control, the creature loses the Might of the Master ability.

***Might of the Master.*** The following numbers increase by 1 when your proficiency bonus increases by 1: the bonded undead’s skill bonuses, the bonuses to hit rolls, and the bonus added to the Constitution saving throw for its Undead Fortitude ability. The bonded creature has advantage on saves versus being turned.

\pagebreakNum
### Channel Power
When you gain this presence at 3rd level, you gain the following three Channel Power options.

***Control Undead.*** As an action, you target one undead creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must obey your commands for the next 24 hours, or until you use this Channel Divinity option again. An undead whose challenge rating is equal to or greater than your death knight level is immune to this effect.

***Death Pact.*** As an action, you can reverse the bond between yourself and your bonded undead, killing them to restore your health. The target undead immediately drops to 0 hit points (Undead Fortitude does not trigger from this effect). You regain a number of hit points equal to the amount of hit points they had remaining.

***Plague Strike.*** When you hit a creature with a melee attack and deal damage, you can expend a use of Channel Power to infect them with a disease. The details of the disease are listed in the Diseases section of the subclass description. They are affected by this disease for 1 minute. If the target is immune to disease, the ability fails and you regain the expended use of Channel Power.

### Shadow Infusion
At 6th level, your spores gain the ability to infest a humanoid corpse and animate it.

If a beast or humanoid that is Small or Medium dies within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to animate it, causing it to stand up immediately with 1 hit point. The creature uses the zombie statistics. It remains animate for 1 hour, after which time it collapses and dies.

In combat, the zombie's turn is immediately after yours. It obeys your mental commands, and the only action it can take is the Attack action, making one melee attack.

### Aura of the Unholy
Starting at 7th level, you let out an aura that grants you and your allies within 10 feet an unholy vigor, increasing their movement speed. Affected creatures have their movement speed increased by 5 feet for every point of you Charisma modifier, with a minimum of 5 extra feet of movement. Allies that end their turn in your aura retain this extra movement until the end of their next turn. 

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Channel Divinity: Unholy Blight
At 10th level, you gain the ability to seed an area with a deadly plague. As a bonus action, you can hurl a ball of plague up to 30 feet away, where they swirl in a 10-foot cube for 1 minute. 

Whenever a creature moves into the cube or starts its turn there, that creature takes your Ebon Plaguebringer damage, unless the creature succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature can take this damage no more than once per turn.

While the cube of plague persists, you can't use your Ebon Plaguebringer reaction.

\columnbreak

### Dreadblade
Starting at 15th level, when a creature under the effect of your Plague Strike makes an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within range.

### Dark Transformation

At 20th level, you can infuse an undead under your control with incredible power, transforming it into an unstoppable monstrosity known as a plague eruptor. See the appendix for the statistics. This transformation lasts for 1 minute, or until the creature is brought to 0 hit points.

The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.

The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.


<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>

> ### DISEASES
> Some of your class abilities cause diseases, which increase in power at 9th and 17th level. 
> 
> At 3rd level they cause disadvantage on ability checks, at 9th level this extends to saving throws, and at 17th level they gain an additional effect. 
>
> The specific ability scores that each targets and the special effect at level 17 are noted in the disease description. Each effect can be removed by any ability that can remove magical diseases.
> 
> ***Brittle Bones.*** Targets Strength. At 17th level, the victim has disadvantage on attack rolls that use Strength.
> 
> ***Deathchill.*** Targets Dexterity. At 17th level, the victim has disadvantage on attack rolls that use Dexterity.

> ***Blood Plague.*** Targets Constitution. At 17th level, the victim becomes stunned whenever they take damage.

>
> ***Scarlet Fever.*** Targets Wisdom. At 17th level, the victim must reroll initiative every turn and has disadvantage on the roll.
>
> ***Crypt Fever.*** Targets Charisma. At 17th level, the victim has disadvantage on saves versus spells.

## Runic Empowerments
If a runic empowerment has prerequisites, you must meet them in order to use it. A level prerequisite refers to your levels in the death knight class.

#### All Will Serve
*Prerequisite: 11th level*

You can cast the *create undead* spell without using a death knight spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

#### Anti-Magic Zone
*Prerequistie: 15th level*

You can cast the *antimagic field* spell without using a death knight spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

#### Bladed Armor

When you are struck by a melee attack that deals damage, the attacker takes 1d4 piercing damage.

#### Blighted Rune Weapon. 
*Prerequisite: Presence of the Unholy, 11th level*

Your attacks deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage on a hit.

#### Blood Tap
*Prerequisite: Presence of Blood*

As an action, you can expend hit dice to regain an expended spell slot. The amount of hit dice required to recharge your spell slot increases as your spells increase in power: 1 hit die at 2nd level, 2 hit dice at 5th level, 3 hit dice at 9th level, 4 hit dice at 13th level, and 5 hit dice at 17th level. Attempting to use this ability without having enough hit dice to spend causes the ability to fail.

#### Conversion

As an action, you can convert your runic power into health. For every point of runic power you expend with this ability, you heal yourself one hit point.

#### Corpse Shield
*Prerequisite: Presence of the Unholy*

As a reaction when dealt damage by an attack or spell, you can force your bonded undead to take damage meant for you. You gain resistance to the damage and your bonded undead takes damage equal to the amount of damage you take. If your bonded undead is reduced to 0 by use of this ability, you cannot reanimate them until you finish a long rest.

#### Dark Rebirth
*Prerequisite: 18th level*

You have learned the ritual to turn another into a death knight. This requires a **runed soulblade**, 500 gp worth of materials (which are consumed), and an appropriate humanoid corpse. An appropriate corpse is one that had at least 5 hit dice, had a Strength and a Charisma of at least 13, and was proficient in all martial weapons and in heavy armor. 

You complete the ritual over the course of an hour, at the end of which the creature is forcibly returned to life as a lawful evil 5th level death knight. This death knight is not under your control and is free to make its own choices. The **runed soulblade** is automatically attuned to the newly risen death knight as their runeblade.

Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again for one week.

#### Dark Simulacrum
*Prerequisite: 13th level*

When you are targeted by a spell that targets only you and does not have an area of effect, you can use your reaction to absorb it.

If the target spell is of a greater spell level than you could cast, has a casting time of more than 1 action, or if you do not cast it within the round after absorbing it, you lose the spell.

Once you absorb a spell, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

#### Dead Men Tell Some Tales.

You can cast the speak with dead spell at will, without using a death knight spell slot.

#### Death Gate
*Prerequisite: 11th level*

> *"With drop of blood, steeped in hate;*

>
> *Return me to the frigid cold;*
>
> *In Acherus, the Ebon Hold."*
> 
> --Isilien, Death Knight and former member of the Scarlet Crusade

You can create a link between sites of death, allowing rapid transport between them. Treat this as though casting the *transport via plants* spell, except the entryway and destination must be some sufficiently large inanimate object related to death. This includes gravestones, entrances to mausoleums, or sites of massive battles. You automatically know the location where you were resurrected as a death knight.

Alternatively, you can use this ability to use the *plane shift* spell, but only to enter the Shadowlands or to leave and return to the Material Plane, with the target location being one that you could use as a destination for Death Gate. 

Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

#### Death Siphon

When you deal damage with your *death coil*, you are healed for half the amount of damage you deal.

\pagebreakNum

#### Desecrated Ground
*Prerequisite: 9th level*

You can cause the ground in a 30 foot radius circle to become desecrated, providing you and allied undead with great fortitude. While in this zone, you and other allied undead receive resistance to radiant damage and can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed.

*Prerequisite: 15th level*

You can cast *arcane eye* at will, without expending a death knight spell slot.

#### Hysteria

They can choose to attack recklessly, gaining advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against them have advantage until their next turn.

This ability lasts for 1 minute, or until you use it on another creature.

*Prerequisite: Presence of Frost, 11th level*

Your attacks deal an extra 1d6 cold damage on a hit.

#### Inscribe Rune
*Prerequisite: 13th level*

You can cast the *symbol* spell without expending a death knight spell slot. Once you do so, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

#### Improved Runeblade

# Appendix

## New Background: 
### Knight of the Ebon Blade

___
___
***“All that I am: anger, cruelty, vengeance - I bestow upon you, my chosen knight. I have granted you immortality so that you may herald in a new, dark age for the Scourge.”***
 
— The Lich King's first words to a new death knight.
___

You belong to the Knights of the Ebon Blade, the order of renegade death knights. Originally created as members of the Scourge under the direct command of the Lich King, they were intended for use as sacrificial pawns to take down a powerful paladin and opponent of the Lich King. Yet instead they were turned into a weapon against the Scourge.

As a member of their order you are probably one of their death knights. The death knights of the floating fortress of Acherus were once great warriors and paladins who had died before being resurrected by the Lich King as his instruments of death. Yet not all who are part of the order are the undead fighters. Former members of the Scourge, warriors seeking to gain the power of the death knights, and honorary members of other factions all make up the ranks of the Ebon Blade.
___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana, Intimidation
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Smith's Tools
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A signet denoting your membership, a trinket of your past (a ring, brooch, a yellowed and faded love letter, lock of a loved one's hair, etc.), a set of travelers clothes, and a belt pouch with 10 gp.
___

#### Feature: Fellow Outcast

Death knights and those who associate with them are almost universally reviled. Those who have distinguished themselves as great heroes may receive recognition, but most will find that people fear and hate them just for their existence. However this does come with a silver lining. 

As an officially neutral organization, the Knights of the Ebon Blade exist outside of the normal Alliance-Horde war. While they will almost never go directly against their race and faction, some fellow members of the order can be convinced to give more consideration to a fellow order member than to their faction, providing information and material aid.

Additionally, you have knowledge of the sigil sequence needed to access the permanent teleporation circle located in Acherus, the Ebon Hold. 

#### Suggested Characteristics

Members of the Ebon Blade are often gruff and sometimes cruel, as a result of their dark lifestyle and urges. Memories of a past life can sometimes temper this, but death knights as a whole tend to be a self-interested lot. One thing they all have in common: a burning hatred of the Scourge.

**d8**|**Personality Trait**
--|:---
1|I will outlive these mere mortals around me.
2|I'm cruel and selfish.
3|I take great joy in torture, and often keep reminders of those I have killed.
4|I show little care for those who I deem weak.
5|I'm apathetic all the time
6|My fate is grim, thus I am inclined to save others from theirs.
7|I experienced death, and I fear it. Because of this, I'm a coward.
8|I want to destroy mankind with an undead army.

**d6**|**Ideal**
--|:---
1|**Selfishness.** I benefit myself, it's every man for himself out here. (Chaotic)
2|**Repentant.** I cannot possibly undo the wrongs I have done, but I can still try and atone. (Good)
3|**Survival.** The shadow will devour all that exists, but it will consume me last of all. (Neutral)
4|**Vengeance.** I was brought into a world that hates and fears me. Those responsible for my suffering must pay. (Evil)
5|**Zealotry.** My eternal enemy – the Scourge – must be hunted and eradicated. All tasks must lead towards this goal. (Any)
6|**Honor.** I may fall, but my Honor is eternal. (Lawful)

**d6**|**Bond**
--|:---
1|I am heartless and I am cold. Yet, it does not mean I do not care.
2|There is no sacrifice I will not make to uphold my honor.
3|I will find redemption, even if it costs me everything.
4|I do not form alliances easily, and trust slowly.
5|I had a friend when I was alive, and I want to know what happened to them.
6|Being feared and hated by all has taught me to rely only on myself.

**d6**|**Flaw**
--|:---
1|I am particularly fearful of death, as I know to where I would return. As a result I can be cowardly or paranoid.
2|I'm used to commanding the unquestioning dead, human interaction confuses me.
3|Some might call me fearless, in reality, I simply lack self preservation instincts.
4|I tire of the world, and find no joy in things.
5|I find causing pain to others a little too enjoyable for most people's tastes.
6|I was once hero, yet how far I've fallen. I can trust no one, not even myself.

## New Items

### Greatsword of the Ebon Blade

<img src='https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/b/b6/Greatsword_of_the_Ebon_Blade_TCG.jpg?version=54e88d87b1646091835ad0e262fa32db' style='width:325px' />

> *The greatest instrument of vengeance for the Knights of the Ebon Blade.*

*Weapon (greatsword), rare (requires attunement)*

This weapon is made entirely of saronite. Taking advantage of the fact that saronite weighs a quarter of normal steel, this weapon is four times as large as a normal greatsword of its type. The wide blade can be a boon to those who fight defensively, allowing a person proficient in the greatsword to receive a +2 bonus to Armor Class when using the Dodge action. 

The incredible strength of saronite allows this weapon to function as an adamantine weapon, and any attack against an object is treated as a critical hit.

For death knights however, the weapon provides a special benefit. When a death knight is attuned to the weapon and using it as a runeblade, they can apply their Improved Runeblade runic empowerment without having it count against the maximum number of active runes.

***Cursed.*** As a saronite item, the greatsword carries the **Curse of Yogg-Saron**, as noted in the sidebar.

> *Bestowed by the Lich King on those who willingly spread the disease of undeath.*

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

When attuned to this item, you have the Undead Fortitude ability.

___
> ### Curse of Yogg-Saron
> 
> Items made of saronite whisper in the minds of those that carry them, slowly driving them insane. Unless an item is sealed in a lead-lined box or kept at a distance, those who spend at least 1 minute carrying, wearing, or wielding the item must make a DC 13 Charisma save at the end of their next long rest. Failure causes 1 point of Wisdom damage, which lasts until removed by magic such as _greater restoration_. 
>
> If your Charisma is reduced to 0 as a result of this damage, you become permanently insane, as you seek out the Master who whispers in your mind. Once you reach this state, nothing less than a _miracle_ can cure your mind.
>
> Undead and Death Knights have shown a remarkable resistance to this effect and can use the item normally without having to make Charisma saves, though the whispers remain.

> *"Forged in the fires of Acherus, these runeblades now serve the Horde and the Alliance."*

*Weapon (greatsword or longsword), common*

An important ingredient in the ritual to create a death knight, the creation of a runed soulblade requires the death of an intelligent being, whose soul quenches the blade and turns it into a vessel for runic power.
