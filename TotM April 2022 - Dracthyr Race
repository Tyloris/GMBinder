## Dracthyr Race
An extremely barebones [dracthyr](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dracthyr) race based on what little we know about it. 


#### Dracthyr Traits
Your dracthyr character has characteristics in common with all other dracthyr.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increase by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Dracthyr mature slightly slower than humans, reach&shy;ing adulthood around age 20 and they can live thousands of year, exceeding the ancient ages of the night elves.

***Size.*** Like humans, they vary widely in height and build, most standing well over 6 feet tall, and weigh around 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Bite.*** Your fanged maw is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

***Claws.*** Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

***Natural Armor.*** You have tough, scaly skin. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.

***Wings.*** Because of your wings, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can't use this flying speed if you're wearing heavy armor.

***Visage Form.*** Using 1 minute, you can transform yourself into a more humanoid form. This form shares some draconic traits with your natural form--such as horns, scales in certain locations, slitted eyes, and so on--but otherwise appears as a human. You always appear as the same humanoid whenever you transform. 

You can transform back into a dracthyr as a free action on your turn, and any equipment worn by your humanoid form when you transform either falls to the ground in your space, merges into your dracthyr form, or is worn by it (your choice). Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

While in your humanoid form, you lose your bite, claws, and wings traits.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.

### Racial Feats

#### Dragon Breath
*Prerequisite: Dracthyr*

You are able to utilize the breath attack of the dragonflights. At the end of each long rest, you can choose a single dragonflight's breath to imitate: black, blue, bronze, green, or red.

When you take the Attack action, you can replace one of your attacks with a blast of elemental energy, unleashing it in 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d10 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

The form of the breath attack and the damage type it deals depends on which dragonflight you are imitating, as seen on the Dragon Breath Types table. You can use your Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

##### Dragon Breath Types
Dragonflight    | Breath Weapon | Damage Type
----------------|---------------|-------------
Black   | Shadowy fire          | Necrotic
Blue    | Icy magic             | Cold
Bronze  | Static-filled sand    | Lightning
Green   | Green energy          | Acid
Red     | Glowing fire          | Fire

#### Dragon Fear
*Prerequisite: Dracthyr*

When angered, you radiate menace. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Strength, Constitution, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You can roar, forcing each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). A target automatically succeeds on the save if it can’t hear or see you. On a failed save, a target becomes frightened for 1 minute. If the frightened target takes any damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Dragon Flight
*Prerequisite: Dracthyr*

Your flying speed increases by 20 feet when you aren't wearing heavy armor. You can also fly while wearing heavy armor at a speed of 30 feet.
