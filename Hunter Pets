## Todo
- Need training points instead of just wild features. Matches the WoW system more and allows for lower tier abilities and split abilities.
- *Split ability examples: Only one keen sense or one skill training.*
- *Lower tier ability examples: Amphibious is not on the same tier as Dive Attack, for the most part.*
- Mechanical creature sidebar? The part about their diet.
- Stable trait is unfinished.
- The bit about swim speed for amphibious.
- Add Reckless trait as part of Ferocity archetype?
- Do the spider's ability scores.
- Elemental nature origin trait.
- Greater Locomotion trait, removing the speed penalty.
- Make sure all abilities are useful at all levels. Example: making the web's hit point total increase with levels.
- Make the archetypes scaling.
- State that the Cunning, Ferocity, and Tenacity archetypes are specifically beast archetypes, as well as for Mechanical Creature, Spirit Creature, and Undead Creature templates. These archetypes use the alternate point buy system.

## Exotic Beasts
### Exotic Features
#### Low-Tier
##### Breath Weapon
Your animal companion can exhale a type of elemental energy. It gains the Breath Weapon trait from the Dragonborn race.

##### Elemental Body
A creature that touches your animal companion or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) elemental damage. Choose the type of elemental damage this feature deals when this feature is taken.

##### Elemental Resistance
Choose a damage type that isn't bludgeoning, force, slashing, or piercing. Your animal companion has resistance to damage of that type.

##### False Appearance
Your animal companion can blend in to the world in a unique way. While it remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from one specific type of object such as a dead shrub or rock.

##### Familiar
Your animal companion becomes a permanent semi-familiar. When you case a spell with a range of touch, your animal companion can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your animal companion must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

##### Iron Scent
Your animal companion can pinpoint, by scent, the location of ferrous metal within 30 feet of it.

##### Limited Telepathy
Your animal companion can magically transmit simple messages and images to any creature within 120 feet of it that can understand a language. This form of telepathy doesn't allow the receiving creature to telepathically respond.

##### Multiple Heads
Your animal companion has more than one head. It gains an extra reaction that can be used only for opportunity attacks. You can select this wild feature multiple times. Each time your animal companion gains a new head which, in turn, gains an extra reaction that can be used only for opportunity attacks.

##### Overtune
Your animal companion can move with a burst of speed. When its move on its turn in combat, it can double its speed until the end of the turn. Once it uses this trait, it can't use it again until you move 0 feet on one of its turns.

##### Shared Senses
You can use a bonus action to transfer your senses into that of your animal companion. You can see, hear, and smell anything that it can. Your animal companion must be within 10 miles of you to use this feature.

##### Sleepless
Your animal companion does not need to sleep and cannot be put to sleep with magic.

##### Unarmored Defense
Your animal companion's Armor Class equals 10 + its Dexterity modifier + its Constitution or Wisdom modifier.

\pagebreakNum

#### Medium
##### Amorphous
Your animal companion can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

##### Confer Elemental Resistance
For any damage your animal companion has resistance to, it can grant resistance to anyone riding it. Your animal companion must have the Elemental Resistance and Mount wild features to take Confer Elemental Resistance.

##### Damage Transfer
While grappling a creature, your animal companion takes only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down), and that creature takes the other half.

##### Devil's Sight
Magical darkness doesn't impeded your animal companion's darkvision. Your animal companion must have the Darkvision wild feature to take Devil's Sight.

##### Displacement
Your animal companion projects a magical illusion that makes it appear to be standing near its actual location, causing attack rolls against it to have disadvantage. If it is hit by an attack, this feature is disrupted until the end of its next turn. This feature is also disrupted while the animal companion is incapacitated or has a speed of 0.

##### Elemental Immunity
Your animal companion becomes immune to one type of elemental damage. It must have the Elemental Resistance wild feature and it must choose an energy type it already has resistance to when taking this wild feature.

##### Innate Spellcasting
Your animal companion gains the ability to cast spells. It gains the Magic Initiate feat, though the DC of its spells are still determined by its Feature save DC.

##### Invisibility
Your animal companion can cast the *invisibility* spell on itself at will. Casting the spell is a bonus action.
