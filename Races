#### Dracthyr Traits
Your dracthyr character has characteristics in common with all other dracthyr.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increase by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Dracthyr mature slightly slower than humans, reach&shy;ing adulthood around age 20 and can live thousands of years, exceeding the ancient ages of the night elves.

***Size.*** Like humans, dracthyr vary widely in height and build, most standing well over 6 feet tall, and weigh around 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Bite.*** Your fanged maw is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

***Claws.*** Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

***Natural Armor.*** You have tough, scaly skin. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.

***Wings.*** Because of your wings, your jump distance is doubled. You can also use the wings to glide, reducing your falling speed to 60 feet per round (taking no damage when landing) and allowing you to move horizontally up to 120 feet per round when doing so.

When you reach 4th level, you can use your wings to fly with a speed equal to your walking speed. You can't use this flying speed if you're wearing heavy armor.

***Visage Form.*** As an action, you can transform yourself into a more humanoid form. This form shares some draconic traits with your natural form--such as horns, scales in certain locations, slitted eyes, and so on--but otherwise appears as a humanoid, such as a human or elf. You always appear as the same humanoid whenever you transform. 

You can transform back into a dracthyr as a free action on your turn, and any equipment worn by your humanoid form when you transform either falls to the ground in your space, merges into your dracthyr form, or is worn by it (your choice). Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

While in your humanoid form, you lose your bite, claws, and wings traits.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.

### Mechagnome Traits
Your mechagnome character has the following traits.

***Creature Type.*** You are a construct.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

***Age.*** True mechagnomes do not age as long as they are regularly repaired and can remain inactive for thousands of years. Some have been around since before the Curse of Flesh appeared over 15,000 years ago, while others are recent creations.

***Alignment.*** True mechagnomes tend to act rather robotic, being very pragmatic and objective. They tend towards lawfulness, though they usually show no predilection towards either good or evil.

***Size.*** Most true mechagnomes are almost exactly the same size and weight, being 4 feet tall and weighing 60 pounds. Your size is Small.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.

***Artificer's Lore.*** Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to magic items, alchemical <br> objects, or technological devices, you can add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you normally apply.

\pagebreakNum

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Composite Plating.*** Your body is encased in protective sheets of metal, which can be enhanced with armor.
- When you aren't wearing armor, your base AC is 13 + Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.
- You can don only armor with which you have proficiency. To don armor, you must incorporate it into your body over the course of 1 hour, during which you must remain in contact with the armor. To doff armor, you must spend 1 hour removing it. You can rest while donning or doffing armor in this way.
- While you live, your armor can't be removed from your body against your will.

***Mechanical Nature.*** You have resistance to poison damage and immunity to disease, and you have advantage on saving throws against being paralyzed or poisoned. You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe. You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep.

***Mechanical Precision.*** You are proficient in one of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, History, Investigation, or Medicine. You are also proficient with one tool of your choice. Whenever you make an ability check with the chosen skill or tool, roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the check's total.

***Standby Mode.*** When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn’t render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.

***True Life.*** If the *mending* spell is cast on you, you can expend a Hit Die, roll it, and regain a number of hit points equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point). In addition, your Titan-forged nature allows you to benefit from common spells that preserve life but that normally don’t affect constructs: *cure wounds*, *healing word*, and *spare the dying*.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish. Gnomish in many ways look like dwarven, it uses the same script, and is renowned for its technical treatises and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural world.

### New Equipment

[Repair Kit.]

[Spare Parts.]

\pagebreakNum

### Racial Feats

#### [Draconic Aura]
*Prerequisite: Dracthyr*

[Benefit in an AoE around you when in Visage form. Based on the WoW dracthyr's Visage racial ability that increases out of combat health regeneration.]

#### Draconic Breath
*Prerequisite: Dracthyr*

You are able to utilize the breath attack of the dragonflights. At the end of each long rest, you can choose a single dragonflight's breath to imitate: black, blue, bronze, green, or red.

When you take the Attack action, you can replace one of your attacks with a blast of elemental energy, unleashing it in 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d10 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

The form of the breath attack and the damage type it deals depends on which dragonflight you are imitating, as seen on the Dragon Breath Types table. You can use your Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

##### Draconic Breath Types
Dragonflight    | Breath Weapon | Damage Type
----------------|---------------|-------------
Black   | Shadowy fire          | Necrotic
Blue    | Icy magic             | Cold
Bronze  | Static-filled sand    | Lightning
Green   | Green energy          | Acid
Red     | Glowing fire          | Fire

#### Draconic Combat
*Prerequisite: Dracthyr*

You have learned to better utilize your other limbs in combat. When you take the Attack action, you can replace one of your attacks with one of the following:
- You beat your wings fiercely, creating a gust of wind in front of you. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Strength saving throw.
- You whip your tail in a quick swipe low to the ground, potentially knocking down enemies. Each creature within 5 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. 

#### Draconic Fear
*Prerequisite: Dracthyr*

When angered, you radiate menace. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Strength, Constitution, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You can roar, forcing each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). A target automatically succeeds on the save if it can’t hear or see you. On a failed save, a target becomes frightened for 1 minute. If the frightened target takes any damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Draconic Flight
*Prerequisite: Dracthyr, 4th level or higher*

You can now fly using your wings while wearing heavy armor. If you aren't wearing heavy armor, your flying speed increases by 30 feet.

#### [Draconic Magic]
*Prerequisite: Dracthyr*

[Gives some basic low-level spellcasting.]

#### [Draconic Resistance]
*Prerequisite: Dracthyr*

[Gain a switchable resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or necrotic damage. Matches whatever breath attack you took for Draconic Breath.]

#### [Draconic Senses]
*Prerequisite: Dracthyr*

[Blindsight, keen senses. See Awakened dracthyr ability.]

#### [Mechanized Innards]
*Prerequisite: Mechagnome or Gnome (mechagon)*

[Choose X of the following benefits. Can take this feat multiple times.]
- Database Access: Advantage on Intelligence checks
- Electric Web: Can unleash lightning attack
- Frickin Laser Beams: 
- H.O.L.O.: Mirror image
- Jetpack: Fly speed
- Overclock: Take extra action?
- X-Ray Vision

**Combat Analysis.** When you make an attack roll and miss, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to your next attack roll against the same target.

**Emergency Failsafe.** You can use your action to roll a number of d4s equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain a number of hit points equal to the number rolled + your Constitution modifier. You can also use this feature at the beginning of your turn if you are unconscious (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

**Grappling Appendages.** You graft two mechanical appendages to your body, such as secondary arms or tentacles. They have a reach of 5 feet, and can lift a number of pounds equal to five times your Strength score. You can use them to do the following simple tasks: lift, drop, hold, push, or pull an object or a creature; open or close a door or a container; grapple someone; or make an unarmed strike. Your GM might allow other simple tasks to be added to that list of options. They can't wield weapons or shields or do anything that requires manual precision, such as using tools or magic items or performing the somatic components of a spell.

**Integrated Database.** You have surgically integrated a database of knowledge into your brain. You gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, or Religion.
