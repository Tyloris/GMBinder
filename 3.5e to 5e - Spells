#### Acid Breath
*3rd-level conjuration (sorcerer, warlock, wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot cone)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of fire ants, alive or dead)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
*You pop the fire ants into your mouth and exhale quickly. The ants distill into drops of pure acid in midair, spattering against your foes and leaving smoking holes.*
___
You breathe forth a cone of acidic droplets. Each creature in the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 12d4 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the spell deals an additional 2d4 acid damage for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Acid Sheath
*5th-level conjuration (sorcerer, warlock, wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of fire ants, alive or dead, and a glass sculpture of a humanoid worth 50 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
*You crush the fire ants between your fingers and rub the smashed mixture over your exposed flesh. The smashed ants liquefy, and the liquid covers your body in a thick, translucent sheath.*
___
You enclose yourself in a fluid sheath of acid that does not harm you for the duration. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. 

The sheath provides you resistance to acid damage. Additionally, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, or when a creature starts their turn while grappling you, they take 2d8 acid damage.

Finally, whenever you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher that deals acid damage, it deals damage as if the spell were one spell level higher.

#### Acid Storm
*6th-level conjuration (sorcerer, warlock, wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a flask of acid worth 25 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantanous
---
*A dark green cloud whirls into being before unleashing a shower of foul-smelling, yellow-green rain.*
___
Acid rain falls in a 20-foot high, 20-foot radius cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature and object in the area takes 16d4 acid damage, or half as much on a successful Dexterity saving throw. The acid kills any nonmagical plant life in the area.

\columnbreak

#### Amanuensis
*Transmutation cantrip (artificer, bard, cleric, wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (blank paper, parchment, or a book)
- **Duration:** 1 hour
---
*You point at the writing and then move your hand as though holding a stylus or quill. As you intone the spell, the script appears on a sheet of paper close at hand.*
___
You cause writing from one source (such as a book) to be copied into a book, paper, or parchment. This spell copies 250 words per minute and creates a perfect duplicate of the original. The spell copies only nonmagical text, not illustrations or magical writings (such as the text of a spellbook or a spell scroll). If the target contains normal and magical writing (such as a letter with a *glyph of warding*), only the normal text is copied, leaving blank space in the copied text where the magical writing would be expected. Likewise, if the target contains text and illustration, only the text is copied. 

The spell triggers (but does not copy) writing-based magic traps in the material being copied.

Blank paper, parchment, or a book must be provided for the spell to write upon. If the target has multiple pages, the spell automatically turns to the next blank page whenever necessary. If more pages in the target exist than blank pages are available, the spell copies the original until it runs out of blank pages. At any time during the spell’s duration you can redirect the magic to copy from another target, copy onto a different blank source, or resume a duplication that was interrupted by a shortfall of blank pages.

The spell does not translate the copied writing. If you do not understand the original, you have no additional ability to understand the copy.

#### Amorphous Form
*3rd-level transmutation (sorcerer, warlock, wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** S, M (a pinch of gelatin)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
*You dust your ally with gelatin and silently evoke the spell. Immediately her bones begin to soften and she and her belongings slump, becoming malleable ooze.*
___
You transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything it's wearing and carrying, turning it amorphous and oozelike for the duration. The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn't affected.

While in this form, the target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes as small as 2 inches in diameter. The target gains a swim speed equal to its movement speed and can hold its breath indefinitely. The target is also immune to the grappled, prone, and restrained conditions.

While in this oozelike form, the target can't attack or cast spells.

\pagebreak

#### Amplify
*1st-level transmutation (bard; ritual)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
*You need to hear what’s going on. A hand motion or two, and the voices become louder to your ears.*
___
You cause an amplification of all sounds within a 20-foot radius of a point within range. You have advantage on all Perception checks related to hearing, as well as vulnerability to thunder damage, for sounds within the target area. 

The creatures within the area do not notice the increased amplification. The spell can be centered on a creature or object, moving with them for the duration. A successful Wisdom saving throw prevents this effect, though it does not grant awareness of the spell.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with the area of a *silence* spell, if both spells are of the same spell level, they are both dispelled. Otherwise, only the lower level spell is dispelled.

#### Animate Fire
*1st-level transmutation (druid)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of charcoal, sulfur, and soda ash)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
*By casting the mixture in your hand at the fire, you complete the spell. Immediately thereafter, a part of the flame coalesces into a vaguely humanoid shape more solid looking than the rest.*
___
You animate a fire, which must be approximately the size of a campfire. The animated fire has the statistics of a [lesser fire elemental](#new-monsters-fire-elemental-lesser), and attacks as you direct. It cannot move more than 30 feet from its source fire.

\pagebreak

#### Animate Breath
*7th-level transmutation (sorcerer)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
*You exhale a flaming tongue of fire, but instead of lashing out against your foes, it produces a creature made of flames that answers to your bidding.*
___
For this spell to function, you must have a breath weapon, either as a supernatural ability or as the result of casting a spell such as *dragon's breath* ^XGE^. When you successfully cast this spell, you imbue the energy of your breath weapon with coherence, mobility, and a semblance of life. The animated breath then attacks whomever or whatever you designate. The spell works only on breath weapons that deal energy (acid, cold, fire, lightning or thunder) damage. 

The animated breath uses the statistics of a Huge fire elemental (MM 99), with the following exceptions.
- The creature deals 2d8 points of damage of the same type as the breath weapon with each successful slam attack, instead of 2d8 points of fire.
- The creature has immunity to its own energy type, but no vulnerability to another energy type.
- The creature does not have the burn ability.


#### Animate Snow
*6th-level transmutation (druid)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
*Nearby snow rapidly draws together with an audible crunch, coalescing into a vaguely human-shaped form.*
___
You cause snow in the area to become 1d3+2 Large animated objects, 1d3 Huge animated objects, or one Gargantuan animated object (MM 14). The animated snow attacks as directed by your vocal commands.

Animated snow does not have a hardness score. It possesses improved speed as if it had legs, granting it a speed of 30 feet, as well as the blind special ability (MM 13). In addition, each animated snow object has the cold subtype and deals an extra 1d6 points of cold damage on a successful hit.

Animated snow objects take 1d6 points of damage per round in a place where the temperature is above freezing.

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Target: Cube of snow up to 20 ft. on a side
Duration: 1 round/level

#### Animate Water
*1st-level transmutation (druid)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a vial of pure spring water mixed with cinnabar oil)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
Level: Druid 1
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: Cube of water up to 5 ft. on
a side
*You indicate a patch of water with a hand shaking from pent-up divine spell power, and the liquid rises into a vaguely humanoid shape.*
___
This spell functions like animate fire, but you can instead animate a quantity of water of at least 4 cubic feet into a Small water elemental (MM 100).

#### Animate Wood
*1st-level transmutation (druid)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (A mixture of powdered cinnabar and ground peach pit)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
Target: One Small or smaller
wooden object
*By touching a piece of wood you release the energy of the spell into it. The wood begins to writhe and twist before your eyes and then rises to move in the direction you indicate.*
___
This spell imbues a Small or smaller wooden object with mobility and a semblance of life, then causes it to immediately attack whomever or whatever you initially designate. Statistics for the animated wood are as for a Small animated object (MM 13). Wooden objects animated by this spell have hardness 5. The spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature. 

Material Component: 

ARC OF LIGHTNING
Conjuration (Creation) [Electricity]
Level: Druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 5,
Windstorm 5
Components: V, S, M/DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Area: A line between two creatures
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex half
Spell Resistance: No
Static fills the air as you complete the
spell. With a gesture you create magical
conductivity between two creatures, and a
bolt of electricity arcs between them with a
shockingly loud crackle.
This bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity
damage per caster level (maximum
15d6) to both creatures and
to anything in the line
between them.
Both creatures
must be in range,
and you must be
able to target them
both (as if this
spell had them as
its targets). Draw
the line from any
corner in one crea-
ture’s space to any
corner in the other’s
space. The bolt affects
all squares in this line.
Arcane Material Com-
ponent: Two small iron
rods.

ARMOR OF DARKNESS
Abjuration [Darkness]
Level: Darkness 4
Components: V, S, DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Creature touched
Duration: 10 minutes/level
Saving Throw: Will negates
(harmless)
Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)
The spell envelops the creature in a shroud
of flickering shadows.
The shroud grants the subject a +4
deflection bonus to Armor Class plus
an additional +1 for every three caster
levels above 7th (for a total of +5 at 10th
level, +6 at 13th, +7 at 16th, to a maxi-
mum of +8 at 19th level). The subject
can see through the armor as if it did
not exist and is also afforded darkvision
out to 60 feet. The subject gains a +2
saving throw bonus against any holy,
good, or light spells or effects.
Undead creatures that are subjects
of armor of darkness also gain +4 turn
resistance.

AURA OF GLORY
Transmutation
Level: Paladin 2
Components: V, DF
Casting Time: 1 swift action
Area: 10-ft.-radius spread
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
You invoke the holy words and a soft
golden light radiates from you. You feel
surer of yourself, bolstered by the power of
your beliefs.
You channel divine power into your-
self, spreading glory to your comrades.
This spell removes any fear effect from
all allies within your aura of courage.

AURA OF TERROR
Necromancy [Fear, Mind-Affecting]
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 6
Components: V
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 30-ft.-radius emanation
centered on you
Duration: 1 minute/level
Saving Throw: Will negates; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
You speak a few curt words and your face
is briefly overlaid with the image of a
violet-shaded skull. The skull fades, but
the nimbus of violet light remains around
you.
You become surrounded by an aura of
fear, granting you a frightful presence
not unlike that of a dragon. Whenever
you charge or attack, you inspire fear
in all creatures within 30 feet that
have fewer Hit Dice than your caster
level. Each potentially affected oppo-
nent must succeed on a Will save or
become shaken—a condition that lasts
until the opponent is out of range. A
successful save leaves that opponent
immune to your frightful presence
for 24 hours.
If you cast this spell when you
already have the frightful presence
ability or a fear aura, the existing ability
becomes more effective in the follow-
ing ways:
• The radius of the area affected by the
ability increases by 10 feet.
• The DC of your frightful presence
ability increases by 2.
• Creatures that would normally be
shaken by your fear aura are fright-
ened instead, and creatures that
would normally be frightened are
panicked.

BABAU SLIME
Transmutation
Level: Abyss 3, druid 1, sorcerer/
wizard 1
Components: V, S, M/DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Creature touched
Duration: 1 minute/level
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates
(harmless)
Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)
You press the viscous ball of demon sweat
between your fingers and speak the eldritch
words. Your flesh and equipment begin
to weep hot red tears that quickly form a
coating over your body.
This demon-inspired transmutation
causes the subject to secrete a slimy
red layer of jelly that coats its skin,
armor, and equipment. A creature
that strikes a slime-protected subject
with an unarmed strike, a touch
attack (including a touch spell), or a
natural weapon takes 1d8 points of
acid damage. Any creature in a grapple
with the target of babau slime takes 1d8
points of acid damage at the beginning
of its turn.
Arcane Material Component: A drop
of babau slime.

BACKBITER
Necromancy
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 1
Components: V, S, F
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: One weapon
Duration: 1 round/level or until
discharged
Saving Throw: Will negates; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes (object)
The weapon you indicate during the spell’s
casting briefly shimmers with a black aura
that disappears in an eyeblink.
You cast this spell on any melee
weapon. The next time that weapon is
used to make a melee attack, its shaft
twists around so that the weapon
strikes the wielder instead. The weapon
hits automatically, and no attack roll
is made.
The wielder gets no warning or
knowledge of the spell’s effect on his
weapon, and although he makes the
attack, the self-dealt damage can’t be
consciously reduced (though damage
reduction applies) or changed to nonle-
thal damage. Once the weapon attacks
its wielder (whether successfully or
not), the spell is discharged.
Magic weapons targeted by this
spell receive a Will save. An item in
a creature’s possession uses its own
Will save bonus or its wielder’s bonus,
whichever is higher.
Focus: A dagger.

BALL LIGHTNING
Evocation [Electricity]
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 5
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Effect: One lightning ball
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving Throw: Reflex negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
With a circuitous pass of your hand through
the air, a crackling ball of lightning appears
before you, accompanied by the smell of
ozone.
You create a 5-foot-diameter ball of
concentrated electricity that rolls in
whichever direction you point, dealing
electricity damage to creatures it strikes.
It moves 30 feet per round. As part of
this movement, it can ascend or jump up
to 30 feet to strike a subject. If it enters
a space with a creature, it stops moving
for the round and deals 1d6 points
of electricity damage per caster level
(maximum 15d6), though a successful
Reflex save negates that damage.
The ball moves as long as you
actively direct it (a move action for
you), otherwise it merely stays at rest,
damaging any creature in its space. It
cannot push aside unwilling creatures
or batter down large obstacles. The
lightning winks out if it exceeds the
spell’s range.
Material Component: A handful of
copper and iron pellets.

BALOR NIMBUS
Transmutation
Level: Abyss 4, Cleric 2, sorcerer/
wizard 2
Components: V, S, M/DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
You smash the soot against your flesh and
intone the ancient, dark words. Like the
legendary balor, your body bursts into
lurid flames.
The flames created by this spell do
not harm you or any equipment you
carry or wear. Each round, the flames
deal 6d6 points of fire damage to any
creature grappling you (or any creature
you grapple) on your turn.
Arcane Material Component: A pinch
of soot.

BEAST CLAWS
Transmutation
Level: Druid 1
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 hour/level
With crackle of popping joints and tendons,
your hands and fingers become long curving
claws with heavy knuckles.
You gain two claw attacks that act as
slashing melee weapons, dealing 1d4
points of damage with a threat range
of 19–20. Attacks with your trans-
formed hands do not provoke attacks
of opportunity.
Your claws work just like the natural
weapons of many monsters. You can
make an attack with one claw or a full
attack with two claws at your normal
attack bonus, replacing your normal
attack routine. You take no penalties
for two-weapon fighting, and neither
attack is a secondary attack. If
your base attack bonus
is +6 or higher, you
do not gain any
additional
attacks—you simply have two claw
attacks at your normal attack bonus.
If you attack with a manufactured
weapon or another natural attack, you
can’t make any claw attacks in that
round. The claws do not hinder your
manual dexterity or spellcasting.
Material Component: The claw of
a bird of prey, such as an eagle or
falcon.

BEGET BOGUN
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Druid 1
Components: V, S, M, XP
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Effect: Tiny construct
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
With the bogun made, you take the
final step and imbue it with sentience,
breathing life into your new servant and
companion.
Beget bogun allows you to infuse living
magic into a small mannequin that you
have created from vegetable matter.
This is the final spell in the process
of creating a bogun. See the bogun’s
description for further details.
Material Component: The mannequin
from which the bogun is created.
XP Cost: 25 XP.

A bogun is a small nature servant created by a druid. Like
a homunculus, it is an extension of its creator, sharing the
same alignment and link to nature. A bogun does not fight
particularly well, but it can perform any simple action, such
as attacking, carrying a message, or opening a door or
window. For the most part, a bogun simply carries out its
creator’s instructions. Because it is self-aware and somewhat
willful, however, its behavior is not entirely predictable. On
rare occasions (5% of the time), a bogun might refuse to
perform a particular task. In that case, the creator must
make a DC 11 Diplomacy check to convince the creature to
cooperate. Success means the bogun performs the task as
requested; failure indicates that it either does exactly the
opposite or refuses to do anything at all for 24 hours (DM’s
option as to which).
A bogun cannot speak, but the process of creating one
links it telepathically with its creator. It knows what its cre-
ator knows and can convey to him or her everything it sees
and hears, up to a range of 500 yards. A bogun never travels
beyond this range willingly, though it can be removed forcibly.
In that case, it does everything in its power to regain contact
with its creator. An attack that destroys a bogun also deals
its creator 2d10 points of damage. If its creator is slain, a
bogun also dies, and its body collapses into a heap of rotting
vegetation.
A bogun looks like a vaguely humanoid mound of compost.
The creator determines its precise features, but a typical
bogun stands about 18 inches tall and has a wingspan of about
2 feet. Its skin is covered with nettles and branches.
Combat: A bogun attacks by brushing against opponents
with harsh nettles that deliver an irritating poison.
Construction: Unlike a homunculus, a bogun is created
from natural materials available in any forest. Thus, there is
no gold piece cost for its creation. All materials used become
permanent parts of the bogun.
The creator must be at least 7th level and possess the Craft
Wondrous Item feat to make a bogun. Before casting any
spells, the creator must weave a physical form out of living
(or once-living) vegetable matter to hold the magical energy.
A bit of the creator’s own body, such as a few strands of hair
or a drop of blood, must also be incorporated into this crude
mannequin. The creator can assemble the body personally or
hire someone else to do it. Creating this mannequin requires
a DC 12 Craft (basketweaving or weaving) check.
Once the body is finished, the creator must animate it
through an extended magical ritual that requires a week to
complete. The creator must labor for at least 8 hours each day
in complete solitude in a forest grove; any interruption from
another sentient creature undoes the magic. If the creator is
personally weaving the creature’s body, that process and the
ritual can be performed together.
When not actively working on the ritual, the creator must
rest and can perform no other activities except eating, sleep-
ing, or talking. Missing even one day causes the process to
fail. At that point, the ritual must be started anew, though the
previously crafted body and the grove can be reused.
On the final day of the ritual, the creator must personally
cast control plants, wood shape, and beget bogun. These spells
can come from outside sources, such as scrolls, rather than
being prepared, if the creator prefers.

BESTOW CURSE,
GREATER
Necromancy
Level: Cleric 7, sorcerer/wizard 8
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Creature touched
Duration: Permanent
Saving Throw: Will negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
Channeling your hatred into binding words
of power, you thrust your hand at your foe
and proclaim a terrible curse.
The spellcaster places a curse on the
creature touched, choosing one of the
three following effects.
• One ability score is reduced to 1, or
two ability scores take –6 penalties
(to a minimum score of 1).
• –8 penalty on attack rolls, saving
throws, ability checks, and skill
checks.
• Each turn, the subject has a 25%
chance to act normally; otherwise,
it takes no action.
You can also invent your own curse,
but it should be no more powerful
than those described above, and the
Dungeon Master has the final say on
the curse’s effect.
A greater curse cannot be dispelled,
nor can it can be removed with break
enchantment or limited wish. A miracle
or wish spell removes a greater curse, as
does remove curse cast by a spellcaster
of at least 17th level.

BINDING WINDS
Evocation [Air]
Level: Druid 2, Windstorm 2
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Target: One creature
Duration: Concentration
Saving Throw: Reflex negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
Calling upon the power of elemental air, you
encircle the target in whipping winds.
The subject can act normally, but it
cannot move from its current location.
The winds carry its voice away, so it
can speak but cannot be heard, and it
cannot hear anything but the roar of
the winds. This spell distracts spellcast-
ers, and so a Concentration check is
required to successfully cast any spell
(DC equal to this spell’s DC + the level
of the spell being cast).
Furthermore, no sonic or language-
dependent spells or effects can be cast
into or out of the winds (though spells
cast by you upon yourself function
normally). Ranged attacks made into
or out of the winds take a –2 penalty.
Binding winds holds flying creatures in
midair.

BITE OF THE
WEREBEAR
Transmutation
Level: Druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 7
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 round/level
With an inhuman roar, your face extends
and expands, and your hands enlarge into
clawed paws. Powerful muscle builds under
your skin, and you become a half-bear
creature.
You gain a +16 enhancement bonus to
Strength, a +2 enhancement bonus to
Dexterity, a +8 enhancement bonus to
Constitution, and a +7 enhancement
bonus to natural armor. Your hands
become claws, granting you two claw
attacks, and your mouth becomes that
of a bear, giving you a bite attack. You
can attack with both claws at your full
attack bonus, but your bite attack takes
a –2 penalty (as if you had the Multiat-
tack feat). Each claw deals 1d8 points
of damage (1d6 if you are Small) + your
Str modifier, and your bite deals 2d8
points of damage (2d6 if you are Small)
+ 1/2 your Str modifier. You gain the
benefits of the Blind-Fight and Power
Attack feats, as well. If your base attack
bonus is +6 or higher, you do not gain
any additional attacks.
Material Component: A tuft of bear
fur.
BITE OF THE
WEREBOAR
Transmutation
Level: Druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 5
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal

You shake your head, and your face reshapes
itself into the visage of a boar. As this hap-
pens, your body becomes bulkier, and your
shoulders and back bristle with hair.
You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to
Strength, a +6 enhancement bonus to
Constitution, and a +8 enhancement
bonus to natural armor. Your face
becomes that of a boar, and you gain
a bite attack that deals 1d8 points of
damage (or 1d6 points if you are Small)
+ 1-1/2 times your Str modifier. You
also gain the benefit of the Blind-Fight
feat. If your base attack bonus is +6 or
higher, you do not gain any additional
attacks.
Material Component: Four boar
bristles.
BITE OF THE WERERAT
Transmutation
Level: Druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 3
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 round/level
With a sneeze, you grow a whiskered snout
and ratlike tail as fine gray fur covers your
thickening skin.
You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to
Dexterity, a +2 enhancement bonus to
Constitution, and a +3 enhancement
bonus to natural armor. Your face
lengthens into a ratlike snout, and you
gain a bite attack that deals 1d4 points
of damage (or 1d3 points if you are
Small) + 1-1/2 times your Str modifier.
You also gain the benefit of the Weapon
Finesse feat. If your base attack bonus
is +6 or higher, you do not gain any
additional attacks.
Material Component: A rat’s tail.
BITE OF THE
WERETIGER
Transmutation
Level: Druid 5, sorcerer/wizard 6
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 round/level
You snarl, and your features shift into those
of a tiger. Your hands grow sharp claws,
and the thick skin and striped fur of a tiger
covers your body.
You gain a +12 enhancement bonus to
Strength, a +4 enhancement bonus to
Dexterity, a +6 enhancement bonus to
Constitution, and a +5 enhancement
bonus to natural armor. Your hands
become claws, granting you two claw
attacks, and your mouth becomes that
of a tiger, giving you a bite attack. You
can attack with both claws at your full
base attack bonus, but your bite attack
takes a –2 penalty (as if you had the
Multiattack feat). Each claw deals 1d8
points of damage (1d6 if you are Small)
+ your Str modifier, and your bite deals
2d6 points of damage (2d6 if you are
Small) + 1/2 your Str modifier. You
gain the benefits of the Blind-Fight and
Power Attack feats, as well. If your base
attack bonus is +6 or higher, you do not
gain any additional attacks.
Material Component: A tiger’s claw.

BITE OF THE
WEREWOLF
Transmutation
Level: Druid 3, sorcerer/wizard 4
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 round/level
A howl erupts from your lips as your
face contorts and expands into a wolflike
form.
You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to
Strength, a +4 enhancement bonus to
Dexterity, a +4 enhancement bonus to
Constitution, and a +4 enhancement
bonus to natural armor. You gain a
bite attack that deals 1d6 points of
damage (or 1d4 points if you are Small)
+ 1-1/2 times your Str modifier. You
also gain the benefit of the Blind-Fight
feat. If your base attack bonus is +6 or
higher, you do not gain any additional
attacks.
Material Component: A wolf’s tooth.

BLACKFIRE
Necromancy [Evil]
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 8
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Effect: Ray
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial and
Reflex negates; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
With the dark words still on your tongue, a
ray of black energy springs from your hand
to wrap the indicated target in black flames
that absorb heat rather than create it. The
black fire crackles and hisses, emanating the
smells of hot metal and sulfur.
You must succeed on a ranged touch
attack with the ray to strike a target.
On a successful attack, a living target
is engulfed in chill black flames that
feed on the fuel of their victim’s life
force. A creature engulfed in blackfire
must make a successful Fortitude save
each round that the spell is in effect or
take 1d4 points of Constitution damage
and become nauseated. A creature
that makes its Fortitude save takes no
damage for that round and is sickened
instead. In addition to its effects on the
subject, blackfire can spread rapidly.
Each round on its turn, any living
creature adjacent to a creature engulfed
in blackfire must succeed on a Reflex
save or become engulfed itself.
Any creature that has its Constitu-
tion reduced to 0 or lower by the spell
is turned into a pile of black ash and
can be returned to life only by true
resurrection or wish, the caster of which
must succeed on a DC 30 caster level
check to restore the victim to
life. If a creature succeeds on
its Fortitude save in 3 con-
secutive rounds, the blackfire
affecting it gutters out. The
black flames cannot otherwise
be extinguished by normal
means (such as immersion
in water or smothering), but
antimagic field, a successful
dispel magic, remove curse, or
break enchantment snuffs it out.
As well, a creature protected
by death ward has immunity
to blackfire’s effects.
Material Component: A pinch of
dust from a vampire destroyed by
sunlight.

BLADE OF PAIN
AND FEAR
Evocation
Le vel: Assassin 2, blackguard 2,
cleric 3, Deathbound 2, sorcerer/
wizard 3
Components: V, S, DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 0 ft.
Ef fect: Swordlike column of
gnashing teeth
Duration: 1 round/level (D)
Saving Throw: Will partial
Spell Resistance: Yes
A three-foot-long column of disem-
bodied gnashing teeth springs forth
from your hand.
For the duration of the spell,
you can make melee touch
attacks that deal 1d6 points
of damage +1 point per two
caster levels (maximum +10). Your
Strength modifier does not apply
to the damage. A creature that
you successfully deal damage to
must also make a Will saving
throw or become frightened
for 1d4 rounds.

BLINDING BREATH
Transmutation [Light]
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 4
You expel your breath weapon, which
crackles with eye-splitting intensity.
This spell functions like breath flare
(page 38), except that targets that fail
their saving throws against your breath
weapon are permanently blinded,
rather than dazzled.

BLOOD FRENZY
Transmutation
Level: Druid 2
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Any creature with the rage
ability
Duration: Special; see text
Saving Throw: Will negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
A hot rush of anger flows through your
target’s veins.
The target creature enters a rage, as
its rage special ability, but this rage
does not count toward the creature’s
number of rage attempts per day.

BLOOD SIROCCO
Evocation
Level: Druid 6
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 60 ft.
Effect: Cone-shaped emanation
centered on you or on a point in
space
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates;
see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
With a hot exhalation and a circular wave
of your outstretched arm, a stifling wind
tears across the landscape, kicking up clouds
of dust and sand and spreading out to blow
over your foes.
A blood sirocco blows out from your
location with the force of a wind-
storm (DMG 95). Creatures in the
affected area of Small or smaller size
are knocked prone and rolled 1d4×10
feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal
damage per 10 feet. Medium creatures
are knocked prone, and creatures of
Large or Huge size are unable to move
toward the origin point of the cone.
A successful Fortitude save allows
the creature to move normally in
that round.
In addition, the stifling winds
dehydrate those within the cone. In
each round when an affected living
creature fails its saving throw, it takes
2 points of damage.
The wind of a blood sirocco automati-
cally extinguishes candles, torches,
and similar unprotected flames. It
causes protected flames, such as
those of lanterns, to dance wildly
and has a 50% chance to extinguish
these lights. The wind of a blood sirocco
continues to blow from the origin
point to the wide end of the cone
for the duration of the spell. Any
creature within this area is entitled
a saving throw each round to ignore
the effects of the blood sirocco.

BLOODHOUND
Divination
Level: Ranger 1
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 24 hours (D)
A white film slips over your vision.
Strangely, your eyes seem more focused and
you note barely perceptible traces of passage
that you had missed before.
If you fail a Survival check to track a
creature while this spell functions, you
can immediately attempt another roll
against the same DC to reestablish the
trail. If the reroll fails, you must search
for the trail for 30 minutes (if outdoors)
or 5 minutes (if indoors) before trying
again.

BLOODSTAR
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 4
Components: V, S, F
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Effect: A bloodstar
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
In a ruby flash a blood-colored, glowing
crystal appears near your foes to suck the
blood from their wounds.
You create a magic construct called
a bloodstar that shoots from your
hand and hovers in the air anywhere
within the limit of the range (each
round, you can move the bloodstar
anywhere within range with a standard
action spent concentrating on the new
position). The bloodstar pulses with
ruby light (providing illumination
in a 20-foot radius). Any creature you
initially designate within 10 feet of the
bloodstar that takes damage from any
source must make a saving throw. On
a failed save, the victim takes 1 point
of Constitution damage. Each time
victims are damaged, they can attempt
new saves.
The bloodstar cannot be attacked or
harmed by physical attacks.
Focus: A ruby worth at least 30 gp.

BREATH FLARE
Transmutation [Light]
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 1
Components: S
Casting Time: 1 swift action
Range: Personal
Target: Your breath weapon
Duration: 1 round
You exhale your breath weapon, and it
flashes brilliantly, surprising your foes.
For this spell to function, you must
have a breath weapon that uses fire
or electricity, either as a supernatural
ability or as the result of casting a spell
such as dragon breath (page 73). When
you successfully cast this spell, your
breath weapon is suffused with bright
light. In addition to taking the normal
fire or electricity damage, creatures
that fail their saving throws against the
breath weapon are dazzled for 1 minute
per caster level. Sightless creatures are
not affected by breath flare.

CHAIN MISSILE
Evocation [Force]
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 3
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
Target: One creature, plus one
more creature/2 levels (each of
which must be within 30 ft. of the
primary target)
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
Bolts of pale blue energy spring forth
from your finger and slam into the desired
target. An instant later, the bolts bounce
away toward other creatures, slamming
into each one.
Missiles of magical energy dart from
your fingertip to unerringly strike
a creature. The missiles strike one
creature initially, then spring to other
targets. Each missile deals 1d4+1 points
of force damage. One missile strikes
the primary target per two caster levels,
to a maximum of ten missiles (deal-
ing 10d4+10 points of damage). After
the missiles strike, they ricochet to a
number of targets up to the number
of missiles created by the spell. Each
secondary target takes 1d4+1 points of
damage, as if struck by a single magic
missile. You choose secondary targets as
you like, but they must all be within 30
feet of the primary target, and no sec-
ondary target can be struck more than
once. You can choose to affect fewer
secondary targets than the maximum
(to avoid allies in the area, for example).
Missiles without a secondary target do
not ricochet off the primary target.
Spells, magic items, and abilities that
protect against magic missile (such as
the shield spell or a brooch of shielding)
also protect against this spell. If the
primary target has that sort of protec-
tion, the spell has no effect against it
but still springs to all secondary targets.
(A brooch of shielding loses a number of
charges equal to the number of missiles
hitting the creature—up to ten mis-
siles.) If spell resistance causes the spell
to fail to harm the primary target, the
spell fails and missiles do not ricochet
to additional targets.
The missiles strike unerringly, even
if the targets are in melee or have
anything less then total cover or
concealment. You cannot single out
specific parts of a creature to strike.
This spell cannot target or damage
inanimate objects.

CLEAR MIND
Abjuration
Level: Paladin 1
Components: V, S, DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 10 minutes/level
A silver glow sheathes your body
as you complete the spell. As the
glow fades, you feel a touch of the
divine at the back of your mind.
This divine touch spreads until
you feel your concerns and anxieties
fade away.
You gain a +4 sacred bonus on
saving throws made against
mind-affecting spells and
effects.

COMETFALL
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Cleric 6, druid 6
Components: V, S, DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Effect: 400-pound ball of rock and
ice
Area: 5-ft.-radius burst
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex half
Spell Resistance: No
You conjure a bright, glowing comet, which
appears in midair above your enemies, then
strikes the ground with tremendous force
and a thunderous boom.
You conjure a comet that immediately
falls to the ground, dealing 1d6 points
of damage per caster level (maximum
15d6) to everything in the area. The
force of the comet can also knock
creatures over. Creatures who fail their
Reflex save are knocked prone. A crea-
ture that succeeds on its saving throw
takes half damage from the comet and
is not knocked down.
The comet breaks apart on impact,
filling the 10-foot-square area with
dense rubble (DMG 90).
You must cast this spell in an area
with at least 40 feet of vertical space
above the point of impact. If you do not
have 40 feet of space, the spell fails.

FORCE MISSILES
Evocation [Force]
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 4
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Targets: Up to four creatures, no two
of which are more than 30 ft. apart
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
Sparking bolts of blue magic, like giant
magic missiles, streak from your out-
stretched hand to strike your foes and
explode in sparkling bursts.
You create powerful missiles of magical
force, each of which darts from your
fingertips and unerringly strikes its
target, dealing 2d6 points of damage.
The missile then explodes in a burst
of force that deals half this amount of
damage to any creatures adjacent to the
primary target.
The missile strikes unerringly, even
if the target is in melee or has anything
less than total cover or concealment. A
caster cannot single out specific parts
of a creature. The spell can target and
damage unattended objects.
You gain one missile for every four
caster levels. You can make more than
one missile strike a single target,
if desired. However,
you must designate
targets before rolling
for spell resistance
or damage.

GEMJUMP
Conjuration [Teleportation]
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 6
Components: V, S, F
Casting Time: 1 round
Range: Unlimited; see text
Target: You and willing creatures
totaling up to one/3 levels; see text
Duration: Until triggered
Saving Throw: None; see text
Spell Resistance: No; see text
You mutter over the iridescent, faceted
gem. It twinkles in response, and you feel
a strong link between you and the stone.
When you speak the word, the two of you
will be reunited.
This spell teleports you to the location
of a specially prepared gem.
You initially cast gemjump upon
the focus, which you must touch. As
a standard action any time after you
prepare the stone, you can utter a com-
mand word and instantly teleport to the
location of the gem, provided you and
the stone are on the same plane.
The teleport is always on target (as
though you are using a greater teleport
spell). If the area containing the gem
is too small for you, you appear in the
nearest sufficiently large space.
You can transport, in addition to
yourself, one Medium or smaller
creature per three caster levels, and
can bring along objects as long as
their weight does not exceed your
maximum load.
An unwilling creature can’t be
teleported by gemjump. Likewise, a
creature’s Will save (or spell resis-
tance) prevents items in its possession
from being teleported. Unattended,
nonmagical objects receive no saving
throw.
Focus: A gem worth 500 gp.

GHOUL LIGHT
Necromancy
Level: Hunger 1
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Effect: Magical, heatless flame
Duration: 10 minutes/level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
A sickly green flame springs forth from an
object that you touch.
The effect looks like a regular
flame, equivalent in brightness
to a torch, except for its green
hue, but it creates no heat
and doesn’t use oxygen.
Ghoul light can be
covered and hidden,
but not smothered or
quenched.
All undead with-
in 30 feet of a source
of ghoul light gain +1
turn resistance. Mul-
tiple ghoul light sources
do not stack.
Darkness spells of 2nd level or
higher can counter ghoul light.
Material Component: A bit of rendered
fat.

GOLDEN BARDING
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Blackguard 1, paladin 1
Components: V, DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Special mount touched
Duration: 1 hour/level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
With a flash, a glowing, golden suit of bard-
ing for your special mount appears.
You create a suit of barding for your
mount to wear. The armor appears
on your mount, fitting perfectly. The
golden barding you create has no armor
check penalty and has no effect on your
mount’s speed. The exact nature of the
barding depends on your caster level.
2nd–3rd: Scale mail barding (+4
armor bonus).
4th–5th: Chainmail barding (+5).
6th–7th: Splint mail barding (+6).
8th–9th: Half-plate barding (+7).
10th+: Full plate barding (+8).
You can cast magic vestment or other
spells that target a suit of armor on the
golden barding.

HEART RIPPER
Necromancy [Death]
Level: Assassin 4
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: One living creature
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
With a sweep of your hand, invisible magic
slams into your target. With a bloody pop
and squelch, the heart of your target bursts
out its back, dropping the creature like a
discarded rag doll.
Invisible bolts of force instantly slay
the target you designate by driving its
heart from its body unless it succeeds
on a Fortitude save. If the target has
HD higher than your caster level, it
does not die on a failed saving throw,
but instead is stunned for 1d4 rounds.
Creatures that don’t depend on their
hearts for survival, creatures with no
anatomy, and creatures immune to
extra damage from critical hits are
unaffected by the spell.

HOLY SPURS
Transmutation
Level: Paladin 1
Components: V
Casting Time: 1 swift action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: Your special mount
Duration: 1 round
Saving Throw: Will negates
(harmless)
Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)
You invoke the holy powers and your mount’s
legs glow with a brilliant yellow radiance.
This spell increases your special
mount’s base land speed by 40 feet. This
adjustment is treated as an enhance-
ment bonus.

ICELANCE
Conjuration (Creation)
Le vel: Druid 3, sorcerer/
wizard 3
Components: V, S, F
Ca sting Time: 1 standard
action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Effect: One lance of ice
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial
Spell Resistance: Yes
You clutch the quartz in your hand, focusing
the energy of the spell into a sharp spear.
With a thought, you send it whistling
through the air at your foe.
You must succeed on a normal ranged
attack to strike a target with an icelance.
You gain a +4 bonus on your attack
roll. If you hit, the icelance deals 6d6
points of damage to the target. Half of
this damage is piercing damage; the
rest is cold damage. In addition, the
target must make a Fortitude save or
be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Regardless
of the result of the attack, the icelance
shatters upon its first use.
Focus: A 50-gp clear quartz gemstone.
Alternatively, if you are in a cold region,
you can substitute 10 pounds of ice or
snow for the quartz.

IMPROVISATION
Transmutation
Level: Bard 1
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 round/level (D)
With an elaborate flourish and call for luck,
you toss the dice in your hand into the air.
Immediately you feel as though fate favors
you, filling you with confidence.
You gain access to a floating “pool” of
luck, which manifests as bonus points
you can use as desired to improve your
odds of success at various tasks. This
bonus pool consists of 2 points per
caster level, which you can spend as
you like to improve attack rolls, skill
checks, and ability checks, although
no single check can receive a bonus
greater than one-half your caster level.
You must declare any bonus point usage
before the appropriate roll is made.
Used points disappear from the pool,
and any points remaining when the
spell ends are wasted. These points
count as luck bonuses for the purpose
of stacking.
For example, a 14th-level bard pauses
while chasing a pickpocket to cast
improvisation. At any time during the
next 14 rounds, he could use the points
to provide himself a +7 luck bonus on a
Spot check, a +7 luck bonus on a Climb
check, and a +7 luck bonus on two of
his attacks.
Material Component: A pair of dice.
