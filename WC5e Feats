# Chapter 5: Customization Options
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, exper-ience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Battlemage feat requires you to be able to cast a spell. If you lose your ability to cast spells somehow you can't bene-fit from the Battlemage spell until that ability is restored.

The feats presented in this book are meant as additions to those presented in the 5th edition Player's Handbook.

### Battlemage
*Prerequisite: The ability to cast at least one spell*
<div style='margin-top:-7px;'></div>

You have improved you technique with spells in the heat of battle, you gain the following benefits:
 - You learn two cantrips of your choice from the mage spell list.
 - When you make a ranged spell attack, you do not suffer disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of the hostile creature.
 - Before you cast an instantaneous spell that requires a spell attack and are unable of hitting more than a single target, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the spell attack roll. If the spell hits, you add +10 to the spell's damage.

### Exotic Weapon Master
You have practiced extensively with the exotic weapons used by certain races, gaining the following benefits:
 - Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
 - You gain proficiency with four exotic weapons of your choice.

### Focus Adept
You have learned some of the tricks that hunters can perform. You gain the following benefits:
- You learn two tricks of your choice from among those available to the hunter class. If a trick you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist its effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.
- You gain one focus die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any focus dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your tricks. A focus die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended focus dice when you finish a short or long rest.

\columnbreak
### Gunner 
You have a quick hand and keen eye when employing firearms, granting you the following benefits:
- Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You gain proficiency with pistols and rifles.
- You ignore the loading property of ranged weapons.
- Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.

### Rage Initiate
You have learned how to tap into your inner rage, using it to perform special techniques. You gain the following benefits:
- You learn two rage maneuvers of your choice from among those available to the warrior class. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.
- As a bonus action, you can tap into your rage reserve to gain two rage points (if you have a rage reserve from another source, the amount it grants increases by two). These rage points are used to fuel your maneuvers and last for 1 hour or until used. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Racial Feats
Leveling up in a class is the main way a character evolves during a campaign. Some DMs also allow the use of feats to customize a character. Feats are an optional rule in chapter 6, of the *Player's Handbook*. The DM decides whether they're used and may also decide that some feats are available in a campaign and others aren't. 

This section introduces a collection of special feats that allow you to explore your character's race further. These feats are each associated with a race from chapter 1, as summarized in the Racial Feats table. A racial feat repre-sents either a deepening connection to your race's culture or a physical transformation that brings you closer to an aspect of your race's lineage.

The cause of a particular transformation is up to you and your DM. A transformational feat can symbolize a latent quality that has emerged as you age, or a transformation might be the result of an event in the campaign, such as ex-posure to powerful magic or visiting a place of ancient sig-nificance to your race. Figuring out why your character has changed can be a rich addition to your campaign's story.
