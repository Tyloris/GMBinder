# Warcraft III Items
### Alleria's Flute of Accuracy
*Wondrous item, Uncommon*

---
*These instruments are wooden flutes bound and trimmed in gold. It is unclear if the flutes of accuracy were named to honor the elven ranger Alleria or if she played a part in their invention. Anyone can blow into the flute of accuracy and call upon its powers, but skilled musicians can increase the range of its effects.* 

---
As an action, you can play the flute, causing those within 10 feet to learn the benefits of the Archery fighting style, gaining a +2 bonus to attack rolls made with ranged weapons, until the end of your next turn. This does not affect those who already possess the Archery fighting style. 

If you have three or more levels in the bard class, this range increases to 20 feet, gaining another 10 feet for every two levels after 3rd (20-foot radius at 3rd level, 30-foot at 5th level, etc.), to a maximum of 100 feet at 17th level.

### Amulet of Recall [WIP]
*Wondrous item, ??? (requires attunement)*

---
*This ordinary-looking piece of jewelry is made of polished silver surrounded by a ring of platinum. A series of spheres of various sizes are inscribed on the flat sides, some overlapping the others like a cluster of moons in the sky. The pattern of spheres rearranges itself periodically, so anyone familiar with the amulet sees a different arrangement each time he studies it.*

---
This amulet is attuned mystically to its creator and can return from him from any location upon command, even if held in an extradimensional space. If someone else is wearing or carrying the amulet at the time the command word is spoken, that person, all his gear, and up to 7 other individuals and their supplie not to exceed a total of 1200 pounds are all brought before the amulet's creator through a dimension door effect. This ability can be used once per day and will not function in an area that blocks teleportation travel. The amulet can be attuned to a new individual only if the origianl owner dies or voluntarily chooses to give up his control over the item.

CL 12th, 17750 gp.

### Amulet of Spell Shield
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

---
*This hemispherical disk is made of an unknown material that is not quite metal, but seems just as sturdy and solid. The translucent surface appears to swirl and dance with vibrant colors hiding deep within its body.*

---
You have Advantage on saving throws against spells while you wear this amulet.

### Amulet of the Wild

\columnbreak
### Ancestral Staff
### Ancient Figurine of Insight [WIP]
This small statuette depicts a scholarly figure seated on a stool studying a large book stretched across his lap. The race and gender of the delicately carved individual is indeterminate, as it wears a hooded cape that drapes down over its darkened face. The entire figurine appears to have been carved of a black crystalline substance that defies identification. 

24 hours after carrying the item, gain a +2 bonus to Intelligence. Once attuned, it can give a +10 bonus to an Int skill 1/day.

### Ancient Janggo of Endurance [WIP]
*Wondrous item, ???*

---
*The thundering drums of war played from high atop lumbering kodo beasts not only intimidate enemies but are often enchanted by orcish shamans to become janggo of endurance that can imbue the warriors of the Horde with magical speed and endurance.*

---
[You can play these drums. While you do, allies within (50 feet) gain a +XX bonus to movement speed and advantage on Endurance checks.]
### Ankh of Reincarnation

### Anti-Magic Potion [WIP]

---
*This powerful item looks like a vial filled with a clear liquid that appears at first glance to be merely water. If viewed carefully, however, small flecks of gold can be seen swirling about within. When unstopped, the potion begins to bubble and seethe like a cauldron set to boiling.*

---
[Immune to ALL magic for 1 minute

CL 12th, 3600 gp]
### Athrikus' Ring of Power

### Belt of Giant Strength
*Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)*

### Bladebane Armor
### Blood Key

\pagebreakNum
### Book of the Dead
### Boots of Quel'thalas
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

---
*Boots of Quel'Thalas are created of soft leather tooled by the high elves' most skilled artisans, then trimmed on silver enchanted by elven wizards to grant the wearer magical agility. They are often passed from one generation to the next in elven families.*

---
While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

### Boots of Speed
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

---

*These boots are a favorite among orcish light infantry, where they provide a speed boost to leaders consigned to ground movement. The boots of speed are created using the tanned hides of kodo beasts treated to remain soft and comfortable on the inside while protecting the feet from rocks and other obstacles.*

---
While you wear these boots, you can take a Bonus Action to click the boots' heels together. If you do, the boots double your Speed, and any creature that makes an Opportunity Attack against you has Disadvantage on the attack roll. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.

When you've used the boots' property for a total of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function for you until you finish a Long Rest.

### Bracers of Agility[WIP]
### Celestial Orb of Souls
### Circlet of Nobility [WIP]
This ornamental piece of headgear is made of gold inlaid with platinum filigree. A single large emerald hangs down over the wearer's forehead, glowing slightly for as long as the circlet is worn. Legend has it these items were created for human nobles, but they have proven so popular that many adventurers now employ them

### Cloak of Flames
Known in some circles as a holocaust cloak, this heavy garment ignites the rage of its wearer in punishing flames.[1]

This is a heavy but normal rust-colored cloak until the wearer draws the hood over her head and speaks the command word; its outer surface erupts in flames that damages any creatures who attack her in melee.[2]

### Cloak of Shadows
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

---
*This black cloak, spun from silk gathered by the nerubian spider lords, allows the wearer to vanish into darkness.*

---
While you wear this cloak, Wisdom (Perception) checks made to perceive you have Disadvantage, and you have Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

### Crown of the Deathlord
### Crown of Kings

---
*This impressive crown is made of gold decorated by lacy platinum strands woven delicately through the surface and around the borders. Gems and jewels of various types adorn the crown's twelve points; and in the center over the forehead, four huge emeralds surround a glowing black opal. Only a few of these impressive items are known to exist, all of them created for human kings in days long past.*

### Crystal Ball
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

---
This crystal ball is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the *scrying* spell (save DC 17) with it.

### Crystal Ball of True Seeing
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*

[Filled with pages stolen from fallen Kirin Tor mages, plus some orcish runes and stuff.]

### Druid's Pouch [WIP] 
### Dust of Appearance [WIP]
[Dispels invisibility in area. Multiple uses.]

### Dust of Disappearance
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

---
This powder resembles fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you take a Utilize action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within a 10-foot Emanation originating from you have the Invisible condition for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect. Immediately after an affected creature makes an attack roll, deals damage, or casts a spell, the Invisible condition ends for that creature.

### Essence of Aszune
### Flare Gun
### Frost Wyrm Skull Shield
### Gauntlets of Ogre Strength
These thick leather gloves appear at first glance to be far too big to wear, and yet they fit small, medium, or large creatures normally. The gloves make their owner's hands and forearms appear unnaturally oversized, although the owner's dexterity and fine manipulation is uneffected. The cured surface appears gnarled and skin-like, even sprouting bristly hairs on the back of the hands and forearm sections.

These gauntlets are made of tough leather and have iron studs running along the back of the hands and fingers. Smart goblin crafters make them look as beaten-up as possible, knowing that orcs and tauren prefer the well-worn look. Some are treated with bullâ€™s blood, which adds no magic ability but makes them look tougher.
