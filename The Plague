## The Plague

At the onset of the Third War, the human kingdom of Lordaeon was wracked and devastated by a new, virulent and extremely infectious disease known only as The Plague. No other name was needed. Spreading from infected grain, within days the plague had spread across Lordaeron’s smaller villages and into major population centers. 

While the priests and paladins of Lordaeron attempted to intervene, the many human victims succumbed to the symptoms of nausea, vomiting, pus-filled boils, exhaustion, delirium, and eventually death. It was then that the final symptom showed itself.

In the dead of night, as bodies began to pile up and quarantine measures were started, the infected dead of Lordaeron began to rise again, walking as undead. Still infectious, and now filled with ravenous hunger, the disease-riddled undead began to rip into their own homes, tearing Lordaeron apart from the inside.

From afar, evil minds were satisfied, for the Plague of Undeath had been orchestrated entirely by the Cult of the Damned, a secret cult of necromancers working for the undead Scourge, at the behest of their leader, the necromancer Kel’thuzad. It was crafted for one thing; create bodies for the Scourge’s use.

The plague, an enormous success, has since left Lordaeron a desolate and empty land, its forests blighted and its earth spongy and sick. Nothing grows, and what little lives there lives a sickly, unpleasant life. Undead wander aimlessly in droves, while the remains of the Scourge’s war machines lay rotting in the sun. A kingdom suffering the full brunt of the Scourge’s plague, Lordaeron is a deadplace, where only the dead live.

Its test site proved a success, and so the Scourge has gone on to employ the Plague of Undeath in grand style, and in countless forms across the world.

<br/>

<div style='margin-top:470px;'></div>

***Virulent Strain.*** The Plague of Undeath was crafted by skilled hands under the command of the Lich King, whose overwhelming power over death bolstered the plague’s power. It was one of several strains of blight and death crafted, and was made specifically to facilitate the conversion of living populations into the undead; those killed become extremely easy to revive into undead, while being extremely hard to cure, as well as infectious to a staggering degree. It is deadly only after time has passed for sufficient infection to spread. It is, in other words, a masterpiece, and a marvel of modern science.

***Ascended Lifeforms.*** To the Scourge, few things are more important than finding new ways to deliver the Plague rapidly. In the old days it was grain, but now they are far more direct: canisters of weaponized diseased fluid; undead monsters loaded with exploding infected pus; infected claws and teeth; dragons that breathe infection across the sky; even the land itself is not safe, as the grubs and worms that fester in diseased corpses then burrow underground to spread the infection further. The experimentation of the Scourge upon living and undead creatures never ceases, and neither do the depths of their ingenuity.

***The Blight.*** A late-stage sign of deep, irreversible infection upon an area is called Blight, and it is a sure sign that the undead have chosen a place as base of operations. No longer grassy and live, the very earth has become sick, with spongy soil riddled with worms bursting out, not with grass and trees, but with fungus, a sickly mycelium growing over and choking previous life, and gigantic mushrooms taking their place. A malaise takes over these regions, with a thick mist adding to an atmosphere of terror. Even worse is the sound; these regions are totally silent. Everything is dead. Here, the undead flourish, strengthened by the death in the air.

### Disease: Plague of Undeath
While there have been several plagues throughout history, when someone mentions "*the* plague," they are referring to the Plague of Undeath, a deadly necromantic disease that ravaged most of the Eastern Kingdoms during the Third War. 

The Plague affects species differently. The original Plague mostly killed humanoids, causing them to rise as zombies and other undead, while some flora and fauna instead sprouted plague-filled growths. The New Plague developed by certain Forsaken apothecaries could even kill the undead. Other variants have existed, developed in alchemical labs and secret cabals.
 
When a creature is exposed to a source of the plague--such as through breathing spores, eating infested grain, or an open wound--they must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, contracting the disease on a failure.
 
It takes 1d4 days for the plague’s symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms range from fatigue, nausea, fever, to minor hallucinations. When it manifests, the infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion and regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.
 
At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the creature’s exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature’s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease. 

The plague is resistant to magic. It cannot be cured except by removing exhaustion levels, and immunity to disease only provides advantage on saves against it. If a creature dies from exhaustion while under this disease, necromantic energies infect the body. Every 24 hours it has a 5% chance to rise as an uncontrolled zombie. If *create undead* or similar spells are cast on the corpse, they do not require material components and the created undead remain under the caster's control indefinitely.

<div style='margin-top:-8px;'></div>

### Plagued Template
A living creature who becomes infected by the plague, yet does not perish from it. Typically they are beasts or plants, as most humanoids die from the plague while most constructs, fiends, or undead are unaffected by it. Plagued creatures manifest different symptoms, such as pus-filled sores and open wounds, green or orange coloration, or fungal growths. 

They retain their statistics unless otherwise stated, and gain the following traits. 

***Alignment.*** The plagued creature's alignment is neutral evil.

***Deadly Plague.*** Poison damage that the plagued creature deals ignores resistance and immunity to poison damage. It can inflict the poisoned condition even on creatures normally immune to it. When it deals a critical hit, the target is infected with the plague of undeath.

***Death Burst.*** The plagued creature lets out a burst of toxic sludge when it drops to 0 hit points. Each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage and become infected with the plague of undeath on a failed save. A successful save results in half damage and no other effect.

***Attacks.*** When the plagued creature hits with a melee attack, it deals an additional 3 (1d6) poison damage.

### Plagued Proto-Dragons
During the Scourge’s spread across Northrend, a cult of worship had begun among native vrykul populations, recently awoken from long slumber. Worshipping the Lich King as a god of death, the vrykul of the Storm Peaks began volunteering to the cause their longtime, ancient animal companions - the proto-dragons, their long-established pets, mounts and friends.

So incensed by this, the necromancers and plague-doctors of the Scourge resumed long abandoned experiments in crafting a new breed of dragon, a plagued dragonflight crafted to spread disease wherever they may fly. In the past this had failed miserably, with few living past whelphood.

Through the use of blighted pools loaded with countless clutches of stolen eggs, the throwback dragon species were far more receptive than the old experiments, and were able to grow into adulthood despite their infusion with deathly, sickly disease. Bleached a pale green and with eternally addled minds, these great, loyal beasts were broken from birth to obey their necromancer masters, and were granted as gifts to vrykul champions of the Scourge, to act as mounts and as vectors of further infection.

The new dragonflight of plagued proto-dragons took to the sky, a terrifying reminder of the totality of the Lich King’s reign over Northrend, reducing even its ancient heritage to his minions.

### Plagued Dragons

Beneath the earth in the dread catacombs of Scholomance, the Cult of the Damned performed sick and twisted experiments on the living. Even dragons were not exempt, as the Cult had "procured" some Black Dragonflight eggs, and had begun efforts to create a living dragonflight worthy of the Scourge.

Sickly green in hue and diseased from the egg, constantly covered in sores and festering wounds, these insane creatures know only suffering and pain, which they seek only to inflict upon others. Through their blighted breath they flood their foes with sickness, spreading the dreaded Plague of Undeath to the living.

***Infant mortality.*** As the Cult has learned, deathly disease causes the rapid end of life, and as such most of these foul creatures have died before they could reach adulthood. Those that do not may also become so unstable or sick that they are simply unable to function. Indeed, a great portion of the experiments - and why the Cult constantly needs new eggs - have been devoted to working out how to extend the dragonwhelps' lives, and suffering, further. 

***Affront to life.*** No people of morality or goodwill may sleep soundly knowing these creatures are alive and suffering, and some groups have devoted their time to eliminating this experiment for good. Unfortunately, they realise that the only way to end the experiment is to end Scholomance itself, a task sought out only by the most powerful among Azeroth's defenders.

<br/>    light becomes dim light and dim light becomes 
<br/>    darkness. Any nonmagical light sources within the 
<br/>    area have the light they produce suppressed. This 
<br/>    effect lasts until the end of the dragon's next turn 
<br/>    and moves with the dragon.
> <br/> **Wrack.** Target creature within 120 feet the dragon can 
<br/>    see must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw 
<br/>    or have disadvantage on Strength-based attack rolls, 
<br/>    checks, and saving throws for 1 minute. A creature 
<br/>    can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
<br/>    turns, ending the effects on itself on a success.
> <br/> **Death and Decay (Costs 2 Actions).** Each non-undead 
<br/>    creature within 30 feet must make a DC 18
<br/>    Constituion saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) necrotic 
<br/>    damage on a failed save. Until the end of its next 
<br/>    turn, whenever the creature makes an attack roll 
<br/>    or saving throw, it must roll a d4 and subtract the 
<br/>    number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw. 
<br/>    A successful save results in half damage and no
<br/>    other effects.
> <br/> **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its 
<br/>    wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon 
<br/>    must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or 
<br/>    take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be 
<br/>    knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its 
<br/>    flying speed.
