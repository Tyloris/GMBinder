## Warlock

### Section One

### Section Two

### Section Three

### Section Four

### 3.5 Text
Born of a supernatural bloodline, a warlock seeks to master the perilous magic that suffuses his soul. Unlike sorcerers or wizards, who approach arcane magic through the medium of spells, a warlock invokes powerful magic through nothing more than an effort of will. By harnessing his innate magical gift through fearsome determination and force of will, a warlock can perform feats of supernatural stealth, beguile the weak-minded, or scour his foes with blasts of eldritch power.

Many warlocks are champions of dark and chaotic powers. Long ago, they (or in some cases, their ancestors) forged grim pacts with dangerous extraplanar powers, trading portions of their souls in exchange for supernatural power. While many warlocks have turned away from evil, seeking to undo the wrongs of their former colleagues, they are still chained by the old pacts through which they acquired their powers. The demand to further the designs of their dark patrons, or to resist them, drives most warlocks to seek the opportunities for power, wealth, and great deeds (for good or ill) offered by adventuring.

Warlocks harbor great reserves of mystical energy. The font of dark magic burning in their souls makes them resistant to many forms of attack and arms them with dangerous power. Warlocks do not wield spells, but they do learn to harness their power to perform a small number of specific attacks and tricks called invocations. Warlocks make up for their lack of versatility by being tougher and more resilient than sorcerers or wizards.

Warlocks are often chaotic or evil (and more than a few are both). The powers they serve can be cruel, capricious, and wild, unbound by conventional views of right and wrong. However, even warlocks who derive their powers from the most sinister of patrons have been known to turn the black powers at their command against evil. A good-aligned warlock is a grim and fearsome enemy of evil. All too familiar with the darkness lurking in his heart, he gazes unflinchingly on the evil in others and battles the foulest of foes without fear.

Warlocks know firsthand the power of supernatural beings, so they do not scorn religion. Evil warlocks sometimes seek the favor of cruel and bloodthirsty deities, while good warlocks often turn to the worship of noble and true deities for the strength to win the battle raging in their tortured souls.

Warlocks are born, not made. Some are the descendants of people who trafficked with demons and devils long ago. Some seek out the dark powers as youths, driven by ambition or the desire for power, but a few blameless individuals are simply marked out by the supernatural forces as conduits and tools. The exact nature of a warlock's origin is up to the player to decide; just as a sorcerer is not beholden to the magic-wielding ancestor that bequeathed his bloodline with arcane power, a warlock is not bound to follow the source that gifted him with magic.

Warlocks are not half-fiends or tieflings by default (although many creatures of those kinds become some of the most powerful and terrifying representatives of the class). The mark that the supernatural powers leave on their servants is often a mark in the soul, not the flesh. In fact, many warlocks are created by nonevil powers - wild or fey forces that can be every bit as dangerous as demons or devils. Whatever their origin, warlocks are widely feared and misunderstood. Most are wanderers who rarely stay in one place for long.

Ambitious and often unprincipled, humans are the most likely to seek out the dangerous shortcuts to power that lead to life as warlocks. Half-orcs are common as warlocks as well, since they often find that the powers that create warlocks do not discriminate against individuals of mixed heritage. Warlocks of other races are rare at best.

The warlock views sorcerers and wizards as bitter rivals. He values the strength and cleverness of resourceful fighters and rogues but rarely gets along with clerics or paladins. Of course, most warlocks understand that it's a bad idea to antagonize their comrades (especially those who hold the key to healing magic), and so they work out an uneasy truce with characters who otherwise might ostracize them.

A warlock serves much the same role in an adventuring party as a sorcerer or wizard would. He is much more limited in his abilities compared to the spell selection of spellcasters, and he must rely on his eldritch blast in place of the spell power of an arcane caster. Like a bard, he often fits best in a party that already has another spellcaster or two, since his unique abilities provide him with little magic to use for his companions' benefit.

\pagebreakNum
### Otherworldly Patron
*1st-level warlock feature* <br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

Each patron also affects certain class features, such as determining the damage type of your *eldritch blast*, altering the type and appearance of your familiar if you choose the Pact of the Chain, or granting additional prepared spells if you choose the Pact of the Tome.

### Occult Magic
*1st-level warlock feature* <br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

**[Flavor text. Receive a certain amount of magic from your patron.]**

#### Eldritch Blast
The first ability a warlock learns is the eldritch blast. A warlock attacks his foes with eldritch power, using baleful magical energy to deal damage and sometimes impart other debilitating effects.

As an action, you can create a blast of crackling energy against a creature you can see within 120 ft. of you. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage equal to 1d8 + your Charisma ability modifier. This damage increases as you level, as shown on the Eldritch Blast Damage column of the Warlock table.

Your eldritch blast's damage type is determined by your chosen Otherworldly Pact. If your Pact offers more than one damage type, you choose one type to use when you use your Eldritch Blast.

#### Cantrips
You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<div style="text-align: center">

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br/> your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br/> your Charisma modifier
</div>

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

\columnbreak

#### Magic Insight
As a bonus action, you can open your awareness to detect unnatural entities and magics. Until the end of your next turn, you gain the following benefits within a range of 60 feet:
- You can sense the presence of magic, seeing a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.
- You know the location of any creature within that range that is cursed, has a pact, or has warlock levels. You do not learn the identity of any such creature through this feature.
- You detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the *hallow* spell.

Your magic insight can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

#### Pact Boon

##### Pact of the Blade
As an action, you conjure a magic simple or martial melee weapon of your choice in your outstretched hand, or you create a bond with a magic weapon you touch. The weapon you conjure or touch must lack the heavy property, and you cannot bond with a magic item that is attuned to someone else.

<br/><div style='margin-top:-16px;'></div>
The weapon grants you the following benefits: <br/><div style='margin-top:-10px;'></div>
- **Eldritch Warrior.** When you attack with the weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls, instead of using Strength or Dexterity.
- **Proficiency.** You have proficiency with the weapon.
- **Returning Weapon.** If the weapon has the thrown property, the weapon returns to your hand immediately after hitting or missing a target.
- **Extradimensional Space.** If your weapon is a bonded magic item that is not sentient or an artifact, then you can use your action to shunt it into an extra&shy;dimensional space. You can summon it back to hand as an action.
- **Disappearance of the Weapon.** The weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for <br/> 1 minute or more, return&shy;ing to your extradimensional space if it is a bonded weapon. The bonded weapon appears at your feet if you die.

##### Pact of the Chain
Using a 1 hour long ritual, you summon an unearthly entity to serve you. It manifests in an unoccupied space of your choice within 10 feet and uses the Pact Familiar stat block. If you perform this ritual again, any existing familiar trans&shy;forms into a new shape but retains its memories; you don’t get a second Pact Familiar.

Your familiar's creature type and appearance is deter&shy;mined by your choice of patron. You can alter fine details of the creature's appearance each time you summon it.

**Combat.** The familiar is an ally to you and your companions, and it obeys you. In combat, it shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. On its turn, the familiar takes the dodge action and moves to avoid danger, unless you use your bonus action to command it to attack instead.

**Remote Viewing.** As an action, you can see what your familiar sees and hear what it hears until the end of your next turn.

\columnbreak

##### Pact of the Tome
Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows, which you can use as an arcane focus. While the book is on your person, you can cast a number of spells through the use of pact magic.

If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.

**Cantrips.** You learn an additional two cantrips from the warlock spell list. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. 

**Spell Slots.** The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

You prepare the list of warlock spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the warlock spell list. When you do so, choose a number of warlock spells equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell *witch bolt*, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of warlock spells requires time spent reading your book and communing with your patron: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

**Patron Spells.** Each patron has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the patron description. Once you gain access to an patron spell, you always have it prepared. Patron spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you gain an patron spell that doesn't appear on the warlock spell list, the spell is nonetheless a warlock spell for you.

**Ritual Casting.** You can cast a warlock spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. You don't need to have the spell prepared.

**Multiclassing.** If you also have the Spellcasting class feature, you can use the spell slots you gain from your Pact of the Tome feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

### Eldritch Invocations
*2nd-level warlock feature* <br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

\pagebreakNum

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

### Warlock's Curse
*2nd-level warlock feature* <br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You can place a curse on a creature that you can see within range as a bonus action. For one hour, once per turn you deal an extra 1d6 damage to the target whenever you hit it with an attack. The damage matches that of your *eldritch blast*. 

Additionally, choose one ability when you cast the spell. The target has disadvantage on ability checks made with the chosen ability.

You can only have one cursed target at a time; using this ability on a second creature will end the previous curse. A *remove curse* can end the effect early, in which case the creature is immune to your Warlock's Curse for 24 hours.

### Ability Score Improvement
*4th-level warlock feature* <br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Optional Versatility
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one of the following, representing a change of focus in your occult studies:
- Replace one cantrip you learned from this class with another cantrip from the warlock spell list.
- Replace the option you chose for the Pact Boon feature with one of that feature's other options.

If this change makes you ineligible for any of your Eldritch Invocations, you must also replace them now, choosing invocations for which you qualify.

### Improved Pact Boon
*5th-level warlock feature* <br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

***Pact of the Blade.*** You gain the Extra Attack feature for the conjured or magic weapon only. With that feature, you can attack twice with the weapon, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn.

***Pact of the Chain.*** You can communicate telepathically with your familiar as long as you two are on the same plane of existence. Additionally, while perceiving through your familiar’s senses, you can also speak through your familiar in your own voice.

***Pact of the Tome.*** When your tome is on your person, you can add your Charisma modifier to the damage rolls of any cantrip you cast that doesn’t already have that modifier added to its damage roll.

\columnbreak

### Contact Patron
*11th-level warlock feature* <br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

In the past, you have usually contacted your patron through intermediaries. Now you can communicate directly; you always have the	*contact other plane* spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot to contact your patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell’s saving throw. 

Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Unstoppable Might
*18th-level warlock feature* <br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

The damage of your eldritch blast cannot be reduced in any way, and when you miss with eldritch blast (whether via an attack roll or saving throw), you still deal half damage to your target.

### Patron's Might
*20th-level warlock feature* <br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

Your patron’s favor is evident, and your power has begun to grow past the pact you first swore, power which can easily shatter the world. You can cast the spell *wish* once without using a spell slot. Once you do so, you cannot do so again for seven days.

If you lose the ability to cast *wish*, you instead lose the ability to create effects that are not spells.
