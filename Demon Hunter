## Demon Hunter
*The enemy came into our world, desiring to extinguish all life. They slaughtered our loved ones, razed our homes..  our cities. You could not stop them. So you came to me, nothing but rage and determination left, I taught you that what once tormented you could give you power.*

*Now you know, no sacrifice is too great if it brings an end to the Burning Legion*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Illidan Stormrage*  </div>

A lone night elf clutching a pair of curved blades, peers to the ground as enemies surround him on all sides, before leaping backwards over the heads of his enemies, swinging his swords at one of them in the process.

A blood elf sprints to the distant aid of her allies, a pair of heavy warglaives in her hands, she releases the fel within, leaving a trail of fel in her path as she rushes in inhumane speed to their aid to jump on the nearest enemy.

A heavily built human standing afar as his allies engage a massive demon, in two swift motions he effortlessly slings his warglaives through the air at the demon, making deep gauges in its hide before returning to his firm grasp.

These hunters have sworn their life to a sacred cause, al-though their motivation may vary, demon hunters are one of Azeroths protectors, these agile hunters carry exceptio-nal skill against the foe they face. They wield both mortal strength and the devastating effects of fel magic, carrying out both with extreme precision


### Feared and Revered
Society often shun demon hunters. Most don't understand the sacrifice that they make, therefore, many choose to become outcasts from their societies. 


\columnbreak

<br>
<div style='margin-top:606px;'></div>


Eyes are commonly turned at them when they wade through towns, most distrust and fear them for what they have become.

    Even though the world are untrusting of demon hunters, it matters not the the hunter themselves, cause they are protectors of the common folk against threats wishing the destruction of Azeroth, and most importantly demon. They are not righteous like paladins that fight for the Holy Light, or selfless like some rogues and warriors. They are the force who battles evil and although shunned by common folk, their aid is appreciated by experienced fighters.

### Power Granted for a Price
Demon hunters are not trained like warriors are, they are created. It is a harsh and incurable process, leaving scars on the individual that will never heal. Most who attempt to undergo the rites to become a demon hunter end up dying from the horrors of what now possess them, or kills them-selves because of what they have seen.

</div>

At its very core of becoming a demon hunter is the con-sumption of a demon's soul in a ceremony, forever binding it to the demon hunter and suppressing it from taking control through magical inscriptions on the hunters skin, infused with fel. Finishing the binding of soul to the demon hunter by burning out their eyes with a magically imbued blade, forever binding the chaotic soul of the demon to the hunter. Other processes are done to create a demon hunter, slowly creating a fully fleshed demon hunter by removing much of who they were in their past lives.

### Creating a Demon Hunter
As you make your demon hunter character,  consider why your character decided to undergo the deadly rituals. Were your family slaughtered by demons of the Burning Legion? Did you strive for greater power through fel and how to control it? Were you full of rage and anger and wished to put it to use beyond raw strength? perhaps you went through their rituals unwillingly, and by a miracle survived the demons attempts to take control? Think of the demon hunters that put you through the rituals and did the rites on you, your relationship to them, are you angry at them for what they have done? pleased with their accomplishment?

Think about what affect the transformation has done on you, physically as well as mentally. All demon hunters who survive the transformation grows horns, varying for tiny studs to massive horns stretching the length of their head. Some demon hunters grow scales on parts of their body, claws on their hands, or have entire limbs misshapen 

into a crude limb of a demon being. No demon hunter goes through the rites unchanged, and no two hunters come out with the same mutations.

Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any fiend within 60 feet of you that isn't behind total cover and that isn't protected from divination magic. This sense doesn't tell you anything about a creature's capabilities or identity. Alternatively, you can expend a use of Spectral Sight to cast *detect magic*.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses. 

When you reach 9th level, you can focus your vision to pierce through matter as well as magic. You can expend two uses of Spectral sight to see into and through solid matter within 30 feet. To you, solid objects within range appear transparent and don't prevent light from passing through them.
