### Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guaardian

_Staff, legendary (requires attunement by a druid, mage, priest, or warlock)_

This staff can be used as a spellcasting focus, and can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class and saving throws. 

***Raven Friend.*** When attuned to the staff, ravens consider the bearer to be a member of their species and are considered charmed, though this effect breaks if the bearer attacks the raven. Ravens often think of the bearer as a curiosity, and the staff-holder will find that there are often ravens who follow them around. Other species related to ravens, such as dread ravens and the arakkoa, are too intelligent or powerful to be affected by this ability. 

Additionally, The bearer can cast _speak with animals_ and _animal messenger_ as rituals, though they can only affect ravens.

***Raven Form.*** As an action, you can shapeshift into a raven form, using the rules for a druid's shapeshift ability listed in the Warcraft Hero's Handbook. See below for raven form stats.

> ### Raven Form
> _Tiny beast_
> ___
>  - **Armor Class** 10 + Dexterity modifier
>  - **Speed** 10 ft., fly 50 ft.
> ___
> - ***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
> - ***Flyby.*** You don't provoke opportunity attacks when you fly out of an enemy's reach.
> - ***Keen Sight.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
> - ***Mimicry.*** You can speak as normal and can mimic sounds you have heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds you make can tell they are imitations with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check opposed by your Charisma (Deception) check.
> 
> #### Actions
> ***Beak.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* *(Str/Dex + Prof bonus)* to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1 piercing damage.
>

***Portal.*** You can use the staff to open a portal, as if using the *teleportation circle* spell. You spend one minute using the staff to trace glowing lines on the ground, forming a 10-foot-diameter circle inscribed with sigils relating to a single permanent _teleportation circle_. The user of this staff must know the sigil sequence of the target circle, as normal. After the spell is complete, the glowing lines fade away, and the staff cannot be used to open another portal for 1d8 hours.

The staff contains the knowledge of the sigil sequence related to the entranceway of Karazhan, the Tower of the Guardian of Tirisfal. It will impart this knowledge to one who is attuned to and holding the staff. The wielder of the staff cannot scribe or otherwise impart the knowledge of this sigil sequence to another, and if they lose attunement to the staff this knowledge is likewise lost from their memory. 

***Enhanced Power.*** Atiesh bonds with its user, enhancing the abilities of the bearer. The form of this effect changes based on the class of the wielder, as noted below. 

***Aura.*** When held, Atiesh also causes the bearer to spread an aura, affecting them and their allies within a 10-foot radius. The effects of this aura differ based on class, as mentioned below. If the bearer possesses at least 17 levels, the range of his aura extends to 30 feet.

\pagebreakNum

#### Druid

***Nature's Power.*** When you cast a druid spell that restores hit points while wielding this staff, the spell restores an additional 2 hit points to each creature affected. Additionally, when you shapeshift into a druidic form, your natural attacks retain the +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls provided by the staff.

***Nature's Aura.*** When someone starts their turn in your aura, they gain a single enhancement die. An enhancement die is a d4 that can be rolled and added to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the die, but must decide before using the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. A creature can only have one enhancement die at a time, can only benefit from the use of one once per 10 minutes, and loses their enhancement die 10 minutes after leaving your aura. 

The die increases in size based on your level: a d6 at 5th level, a d8 at 9th level, a d10 at 13th level, and d12 at 17th level. 

#### Mage

***Arcane Power.*** When you cast a mage spell while wielding this staff, you gain a +2 bonus to the spell attack roll and to the saving throw DCs. Additionally, if the spell successfully deals damage, it deals +2 points of that damage type to each creature affected.

***Arcane Aura.*** When someone under the effects of your aura roll a 1 on a damage die for the effects of a spell they cast, they can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if it is another 1. They can do this for a number of dice per spell equal to your proficiency modifier. 

#### Priest

***Holy Power.*** When you cast a priest spell while wielding this staff, you gain a +2 bonus to the spell attack roll and to the saving throw DCs. Additionally, if the spell restores hit points, it restores an additional 2 hit points to each creature affected.

***Holy Aura.*** When someone under the effects of your aura regains lost hit points, they regain an additional amount of hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. 

#### Warlock

***Fel Power.*** When you cast a warlock spell while wielding this staff, you gain a +2 bonus to the spell attack roll and to the saving throw DCs. Additionally, warlock spells that you cast crit on a roll of 19 or 20. If you crit against a target under the effect of your Curse of Agony, the critical hit deals an additional die of damage.

***Fel Aura.*** When someone under the effect of your aura deals magical damage (non-bludgeoning, piecing, or slashing damage), they deal an additional number of points of that damage to each creature equal to your proficiency bonus.

### Benediction / Anathema

_Staff, very rare (requires attunement by priest)_

The staff can either take the form of the golden staff Benediction or the silver staff Anathema. Some of its properties vary based on which form it currently takes, while others are shared between forms.

***Universal Abilities.*** The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you have resistance to necrotic damage and you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls. 

The staff can be used as a holy symbol. The gem in the staff shines with an inner light, which can be suppressed or resumed as an action. In its Benediction form, the light is as bright as a torch, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. In its Anathema form, the light is softer and more akin to moonlight, providing bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet.

The staff can be transformed between its Benediction and Anathema forms as an action. Once this ability has been used, it cannot be used again for 1 hour.

The staff has 20 charges, and regains 2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the gem becomes a dull colorless crystal that no longer sheds light while the staff fades to a tarnished silver, and while the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls, it loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regains 1d8 + 2 charges.

The staff can either take the form of the golden staff Benediction or the silver staff Anathema. Some of its properties vary based on which form it currently takes, while others are shared between forms.

#### Benediction

_Behind every shadow there is the light of hope._

***Benediction.*** The golden Benediction form has the following abilities.
- _Holy Light._ While holding Benediction, spells that you cast that deal radiant damage score a critical hit on a roll of a 19 or 20.
- _Healing Light._ While holding Benediction, whenever you cast a spell that restores hit points to a creature, it restores an additional amount equal to your proficiency bonus.
- _Spells._ While holding this staff, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: cure wounds (1 charge per spell level, up to 4th), lesser restoration (2 charges), or mass cure wounds (5 charges).

\pagebreakNum

#### Anathema

_For every light, there is a shadow._

***Anathema.*** The Anathema form has the following abilities.
- _Shadow Energy._ While holding Anathema, you can expend 1 charge as a bonus action to restore 2 light points.
- _Shadow Power._ While holding Anathema, whenever you deal necrotic damage to a creature, it deals an additional amount equal to your proficiency bonus.
- _Spells_ While holding this staff, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: dark void† (1 charge per spell level, up to 4th), void strike† (2 charges), or negative energy flood†† (5 charges).

† _Dark void_ and _void strike_ are depicted in the Warcraft Hero's Handbook.

†† _Negative energy flood_ is depicted in Xanathar's Guide to Everything.

### Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest

_Staff, legendary (requires attunement by a spellcaster)_

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While you hold it, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls and to spell save DCs.

The staff has 50 charges for the following properties. It regains 4d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 20, the staff regains 1d12 + 1 charges.

***Spell Absorption.*** While holding the staff, you have advantage on saving throws against spells. In addition, you can use your reaction when another creature casts a spell that targets only you. If you do, the staff absorbs the magic of the spell, canceling its effect and gaining a number of charges equal to the absorbed spell's level. However, if doing so would bring the staff's total number of charges above 50, the ability fails and you are affected as normal.

***Wrath of Tarecgosa.*** While holding the staff, you can expend some of the charges to duplicate spells. You can convert the charges held within the staff to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.

Alternatively, you can use the charges to duplicate a spell you have witnessed recently cast. The spell must have been cast within 60 feet of you, you must have witnessed the person casting it, it must have been cast within the last round, it must be of a spell level that you can cast, you must provide any expensive material components needed by the spell, and there must be enough charges in the staff to fuel the spell. The spell does not need to be one that is on your class list or a spell that you can normally cast, as long as it meets these other requirements.

***Tarecgosa's Visage.*** While holding the staff, you can expend four charges to transform into an echo of the power of the blue dragon Tarecgosa. This uses the rules for a druid's shapeshift ability, as noted in the Warcraft Hero's Handbook, and the stats listed in the sidebar below. 

If you are at least level 7, you can instead use the staff to polymorph into a blue drake, as if using the spell. The statistics for a blue drake are depicted in the Manual of Monsters.

Using this ability requires that the one attuned and the spirit housed in the staff to not only not be in conflict, but for there to be a genuine connection between the two. Generally this only occurs when the bearer has accomplished some great deed in regards to magic, or when the interests and goals of the two are in alignment.

***Sentience.*** *Dragonwrath* is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision out to 60 ft., and blindsight out to 10 ft.

The staff can speak, read, and understand Common and Draconic, and can communicate with its bearer telepathically. Its voice is feminine and aristocratic. While you are attuned to it, *Dragonwrath* also understands every language you know.

***Personality.*** Tarecgosa, the blue dragon whose spirit is housed inside *Dragonwrath*, speaks with a slight condescension towards mortal creatures. She does not do so maliciously; she merely believes that mortality prevents one from having perspective necessary to properly understand the nature of magic. When carried by an accomplished magic-user, Tarecgosa gets over her prejudice and becomes genuinely affectionate and appreciative.

*Dragonwrath*'s purpose is that of the blue dragonflight: magic. Acquiring it, researching it, cataloging it. Magic must be regulated, managed, and controlled. But it must also be appreciated and valued and not hoarded. She is content to act mostly as on observer, unless she witnesses some interesting spell or a creature abusing magic in some way.

If the bearer works against the cause of magic, such as selfishly hoarding knowledge and magic items for personal gain, a conflict will occur.

> - **Speed** 40 ft., fly 80 ft.

### Fangs of the Father

*Weapon (2 daggers), legendary (requires attunement by a rogue)*

Fangs of the Father is a paired set of daggers. A rogue cannot attune to just one, he must attune to both **Golad, Twilight of Aspects** and **Tiriosh, Nightmare of Ages**, and uses only a single attunement slot for the both of them.

Each is a dagger that provides a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls and if either is on your person you can use your reaction to cast _feather fall_ on yourself. However, the full benefit of these daggers only comes into play if both are used as part of two-weapon fighting.

***Twin Fangs.*** While engaging in two-weapon fighting while wielding *Golad* in one hand and *Tiriosh* in the other, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. You can also add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. You can make this second attack with advantage if you hit with the first dagger as part of the Attack action.

In addition, if a target is hit by both daggers in the same round, it takes an additional 1d4 slashing damage from the second attack and cannot make an attack of opportunity against you for the rest of your turn.

***Shadows of the Destroyer.*** Every time you successfully hit an opponent with either of the daggers, they gain a charge. A charge gained this way is shared between both daggers. The daggers can hold up to 30 charges; any charges in excess of this total are wasted. You can use your action to spend 3 charges to regain a point of energy.

***Fury of the Destroyer.*** You can expend three charges (gained through _shadow of the Destroyer_) as part of your Attack action to make an extra attack with one of your daggers. You can only do this twice per turn: once with your main hand and once with your off hand.

### Rhok'delar, Longbow of the Ancient Keepers

*Weapon (longbow), legendary (requires attunement by a hunter)*

**Rhok'delar** is a weapon with two forms. When it is unstrung, it can be used as a quarterstaff and is known as **Lok'delar** instead. In addition to its other form, it is also paired with an unnamed quiver made of leaves and dragonhide; where the bow goes, the quiver follows. The weapon is alive, and is known to occasionally glow a soft green or sprout blossoms and vines, though these do not interfere in the use of the weapon. 

***Transform.*** As an action, you can unstring the bow and use it as a quarterstaff. In this form, it is known as Lok'delar, Stave of the Ancient Keepers. You can restring it as an action, returning it to the form of a longbow.

***Weapon of the Ancients.*** The weapon provides a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls, and provides advantage on attacks versus fiends made using this weapon. While carrying it, you have resistance to poison damage and advantage on saving throws versus being poisoned and the poisoned condition. When you score a critical hit with an attack from this weapon, you can roll an additional die equal to the weapon's damage and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.

***Ancient Sinew Wrapped Lamina.*** The quiver can hold more arrows than it seems like it normally could; it can contain up to 60 arrows in an extradimensional space. The quiver also has a compartment on its side that can easily hold Rhok'delar, whether strung or unstrung. It also extends a protective quality over the arrows it holds. Arrows stored in the quiver cannot be broken, unless they enter an antimagic field. This effect lasts for 1 round after leaving the quiver.

### Shadowmourne

*Weapon (greataxe), legendary (requires attunement by a death knight)*

Shadowmourne provides a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls, as well as the following abilities. A death knight treats Shadowmourne as his rune weapon for as long as he is attuned to it.

***Saronite Weapon.*** Shadowmourne is made out of saronite, the crystallized blood of the Old God Yogg-Saron. As such, it has certain effects, as noted below. 
- It casts a blue-green light as a candle. This effect cannot be suppressed.
- It is resistant to all forms of damage, except for acid damage. It is immune to radiant damage.
- When used as part of an attack that deals radiant damage, it reacts violently. The spell or ability automatically fails (with the action wasted), the person activating the ability takes an amount of radiant damage equal to the number of dice in the original effect, and they must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or be knocked prone.
- It is particularly good at breaking objects. Whenever Shadowmourne hits an object, the hit is a critical hit.
- Shadowmourne deals damage to the soul as well as the body. It ignores slashing damage resistance.
 
***Curse of Yogg-Saron.*** The user of Shadowmourne is subject to the Curse of Yogg-Saron, as noted in the sidebar on the next page. 
***Soul Fragments.*** Shadowmourne shaves off and devours pieces of souls, both those it cuts and those of the wielder if they are not careful. It stores these pieces inside itself as charges, which can be used to power its other abilities. Shadowmourne gains a charge whenever it is used to deal a critical hit or if a creature within 5 feet is reduced to 0 hit points. It can hold a maximum of 13 charges. Any charges in excess of this total are lost and attempting to use an ability when no charges remain causes the bearer to take 2d6 points of damage instead.

***Power of Blood, Frost, and the Unholy.*** While wielding Shadowmourne, for every 4 charges currently stored in it, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and to spell save DCs, to a maximum of +3.

***Chaos Bane.*** By expending charges, you can unleash a flood of negative energy. All other creatures within 15 feet of you take 2d6 necrotic damage. For each charge beyond the first that you expend, the damage increases by 2d6 and the range increases by 5 feet. 

You are bolstered by this effect, gaining advantage on all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks for a number of rounds equal to the number of charges expended.

\pagebreakNum

***Devour Soul.*** Whenever you use it to reduce a creature to 0 hit points, the sword slays the creature devours its soul, unless it is a construct or an undead. A creature whose soul has been devoured by Shadowmourne can be restored to life only by a *wish* spell.

> ### Curse of Yogg-Saron
> 
> Items made of saronite whisper in the minds of those that carry them, slowly driving them insane. Unless an item is sealed in a lead-lined box or kept at a distance, those who spend at least 1 minute carrying, wearing, or wielding the item must make a DC 15 Charisma save at the end of their next long rest. Failure causes 1 point of Charisma damage, which lasts until removed by magic such as _greater restoration_. 
>
> If your Charisma is reduced to 0 as a result of this damage, you become permanently insane, as you seek out the Master who whispers in your mind. Once you reach this state, nothing less than a _wish_ can cure your mind.
>
> Undead and Death Knights have shown a remarkable resistance to this effect and can use the item normally without having to make Charisma saves, though the whispers remain.

### Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros

_Weapon (maul), legendary (requires attunement)_

**Sulfuras** is a maul that is massive even for its type. It weighs 20 lbs and deals 2d8 points of bludgeoning damage when it hits. 

***Hammer of the Firelord.*** The spiked head of this maul constantly glows red with a heat that cannot be suppressed. It sheds bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. When you successfully hit a creature with this weapon, it takes an additional 2d6 points of fire damage. When a creature hits you with a melee attack, they take 5 points of fire damage.

When attuned to and holding Sulfuras, you have fire resistance. Those who are not attuned to the weapon who attempt to touch it take 1 point of fire damage every round they do so. Any unattended flammable object that touches the head of the hammer is ignited.

***Eye of Sulfuras.*** As an action, you can swing Sulfuras and launch an orb of fire, making a ranged attack against a creature you can see within 60 feet. The attack modifier is the same as if you were making a melee attack, and the attack deals 2d6 fire damage on a hit and potentially setting them aflame. The creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity save at the beginning of their next turn and at the beginning of each of their turns thereafter, taking 1d4 points of fire damage on a failure. This lasts for 1 minute, until they make a successful save, or until they take an action to extinguish the flames.

### Thori'dal, the Star's Fury

_Weapon (longbow), legendary (requires attunement)_

Attacks made with this weapon gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

***Endless Ammunition.*** By pulling back the string of this bow when no ammunition is loaded, a magical arrow is produced, nocked and ready to fire. Once removed from the string, either by launching the arrow in an attack or by any other means, the arrow disappears at the end of the round.

***Rapid Fire.*** Thori'dal's ability to generate ammunition allows more arrows to be fired in the same amount of time. On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to make two attacks with this longbow. These extra attacks must only use the magical arrows provided by the *endless ammunition* ability. 

***Defensive Weapon.*** Thori'dal has a broad metal hand cover worked into the weapon. This helps provide some level of defense, granting a +1 bonus to AC as if using a buckler. This ability does not require for the wielder to be proficient in shields, nor are they penalized if they lack this proficiency.

### Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker

*Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement)*

When attuned to this weapon, you have resistance to lightning and thunder damage. Attacks made with this weapon gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls.  When you hit a creature with this weapon, your attacks deal an additional 1d6 lightning damage. 

Whenever your attack roll comes up as 16 or higher on the d20, two additional effects occur. First, a bolt of lightning leaps from the initial target and attacks the nearest enemy to the initial target within 30 feet. Use the same attack roll and modifier as the initial attack. If the attack is a hit, then the bolt continues to the nearest enemy target within 30 feet. It continues until the first miss or until up to 5 targets are hit by this bolt. No creature can be hit more than once by this effect.

Upon being hit by this bolt, the first creature takes 1d4 lightning damage and gains vulnerability to lightning damage for 1 round. This damage increases for each successive strike, increasing to 1d6 for the second target, 1d8 for the third, 1d10 for the fourth, and 1d12 for the fifth. When this effect occurs, a loud crack of thunder can be heard up to 300 feet away.

Additionally, the initial target is wreathed in a cyclone of imprisoning wind, hampering their attacks. They suffer a -2 penalty to attack and damage rolls.

### Twin Blades of Azzinoth

*Weapons (warglaives), legendary (requires attunement by a demon hunter)*

When you attune to these weapons, you must attune to both at the same time. They only take up a single attunement slot. Attacks with these weapons have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls. When attacking a fiend, this bonus increases to +4.

When you attack and roll a natural 20 on the attack roll, the attack deals an extra 2d6 slashing damage. This increases to 4d6 if the creature is a fiend. If a fiend has 25 hit points or less after taking this damage, it is destroyed. 

While attuned to these weapons, you can call them to hand as a bonus action as long as they are on the same plane. You can call one or both as part of the same bonus action.
