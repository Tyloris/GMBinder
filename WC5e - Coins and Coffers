## Weapons
The Weapons table in this section shows the game's main weapons. The table lists the cost and weight of each weapon, as well as the following details:
___
- **Category.** Every weapon falls into a category: Simple or Martial. Weapon proficiencies are usually tied to one of these categories. For example, you might have proficiency with Simple weapons.
- **Melee or Ranged.** A weapon is classified as either Melee or Ranged. A Melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet, whereas a Ranged weapon is used to attack at a greater distance.
- **Damage.** The table lists the amount of damage a weapon deals when an attacker hits with it as well as the type of that damage.
- **Properties.** Any properties a weapon has are listed in the Properties column. Each property is defined in the “Properties” section.
- **Mastery.** Each weapon has a mastery property, which is defined in the “Mastery Properties” section later in this chapter. To use that property, you must have a feature that lets you use it.

### Weapon Proficiency
Anyone can wield a weapon, but you must have proficiency with it to add your Proficiency Bonus to an attack you make with it. A player character's features can provide weapon proficiencies. A monster is proficient with any weapon in its stat block.

### Properties
Here are definitions of the properties in the Properties column of the Weapons table.

#### Ammunition	
You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition required is specified with the weapon's range. Each attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the rest is lost.

\columnbreak

#### NEW: Aquatic
When making an attack underwater with an aquatic weapon, you do not have disadvantage on attack rolls if you do not have a swim speed (see page 198 of the Player's Handbook for more details).

#### NEW: Covert
If you are hidden, a missed attack with a covert weapon does not reveal you.

#### NEW: Double

#### Finesse
When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

#### Heavy	
You have Disadvantage on attack rolls with a Heavy weapon if it's a Melee weapon and your Strength score isn't at least 13 or if it's a Ranged weapon and your Dexterity score isn't at least 13.

#### NEW: Hidden

#### Light	
When you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don’t add your ability modifier to the extra attack’s damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you don't add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.

#### Loading	
You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

#### NEW: Nonlethal

#### Range	
A Range weapon has a range in parentheses after the Ammunition or Thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second is the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have Disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the long range.

#### Reach	
A Reach weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for Opportunity Attacks with it.

\pagebreakNum

#### NEW: Splash
All splash weapons are either ranged thrown weapons or pieces of ammunition. On a hit with a splash weapon, the weapon/ammunition is destroyed, and you don't add any ability modifier to the damage roll. All creatures within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 10 or 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or also suffer the splash weapon's damage. If you're proficient with the weapon, this saving throw is made against your Dexterity DC. If you're not proficient, the DC is 10.

#### Thrown	
If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you use for a melee attack with that weapon.

#### Two-Handed
A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

#### NEW: Unwieldy
During your turn you cannot attack before or after moving with this weapon.

#### NEW: Variable
Can deal alternative damage type (ex: dagger--slashing/piercing)

#### Versatile	
A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.

### Mastery Properties
Each weapon has a mastery property, which is usable only by a character who has a feature, such as Weapon Mastery, that unlocks the property for the character. The properties are defined below.

#### Cleave
If you hit a creature with a melee attack roll using this weapon, you can make a melee attack roll with the weapon against a second creature within 5 feet of the first that is also within your reach. On a hit, the second creature takes the weapon’s damage, but don't add your ability modifier to that damage unless that modifier is negative. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.

#### Graze	
If your attack roll with this weapon misses a creature, you can deal damage to that creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the attack roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon, and the damage can be increased only by increasing the ability modifier.

#### Nick	
When you make the extra attack of the Light property, you can make it as part of the Attack action instead of as a Bonus Action. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.

#### Push	
If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can push the creature up to 10 feet straight away from yourself if it is Large or smaller.

#### Sap	
If you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature has Disadvantage on its next attack roll before the start of your next turn.

#### Slow	
If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to it, you can reduce its Speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. If the creature is hit more than once by weapons that have this property, the Speed reduction doesn’t exceed 10 feet.

#### Topple	
If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, the creature has the Prone condition.

#### Vex	
If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to the creature, you have Advantage on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.

> #### Improvised Weapons
> If you use an object — such as a table leg, frying pan, or bottle — as a makeshift weapon, see Improvised Weapons in the rules glossary. Also see those rules if you wield a weapon in an unusual way, such as using a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack.
> 
> ##### Improvised Weapons (Rules Glossary)
> An improvised weapon is an object wielded as a makeshift weapon, such as broken glass, a table leg, or a frying pan. A Simple or Martial weapon also counts as an improvised weapon if it's wielded in a way contrary to its design; if you use a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack or throw a Melee weapon that lacks the Thrown property, the weapon counts as an improvised weapon. An improvised weapon follows the rules below.
> ___
> - **Proficiency.** Don't add your Proficiency Bonus to attack rolls with an improvised weapon.
> - **Damage.** On a hit, the weapon deals 1d4 damage of a type the DM thinks is appropriate for the object.
> - **Range.** If you throw the weapon, it has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.
> - **Weapon Equivalents.** If an improvised weapon resembles a Simple or Martial weapon, the DM may say it functions as that weapon and uses that weapon's rules. For example, the DM could treat a table leg as a Club.

## Armor
The Armor table lists the game’s main armor. The table includes the cost and weight of armor, as well as the following details:
___
- **Category.** Every type of armor falls into a category: Light, Medium, or Heavy. The category determines how long it takes to don or doff the armor (as shown in the table).
- **Armor Class (AC).** The table’s Armor Class column tells you what your base AC is when you wear a type of armor. For example, if you wear Leather Armor, your base AC is 11 plus your Dexterity modifier, whereas your AC is 16 in Chain Mail.
- **Strength.** If the table shows a Strength score in the Strength column for an armor type, that armor reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.
- **Stealth.** If the table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column for an armor type, the wearer has Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.


### Armor Training
Anyone can don armor or hold a Shield, but only those with training can use them effectively, as explained below. A character’s class and other features determine the character’s armor training. A monster has training with any armor in its stat block.

#### Light, Medium, or Heavy Armor
If you wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack training with it, you have Disadvantage on any D20 Test that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.

#### Shield
You gain the Armor Class benefit of a Shield only if you have training with it.

### One at a Time
A creature can wear only one suit of armor at a time and wield only one Shield at a time.

> ##### Variant: Equipment Sizes
> In most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that you find on your adventures, within the bounds of common sense. For example, an orc adventurer won't fit in a halfling's Leather Armor, and a cloud giant’s robe would be far too large for a gnome.
> 
> The DM can impose more realism. For example, a suit of Plate Armor made for one human might not fit another one without significant alterations, and a guard's uniform might be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it as a disguise.
> 
> Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing, and similar items that are made to be worn, they might need to visit a smith, a tailor, a leatherworker, or a similar expert to make the item wearable. The cost for such work is 1d4 X 10 percent of the market price of the item.

Massive (5e Variant Rule)
Jump to navigationJump to search
Massive
During your turn you cannot attack before or after moving with a massive weapon.

https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Massive_(5e_Variant_Rule)




A blowgun is a simple ranged weapon consisting of a narrow, long tube designed for firing light projectiles or darts. You attack with the by inserting a needle inside the pipe, then blowing sharply into one end to shoot the projectile out the opposite side. Unlike most ammunition weapons, a blowgun can be both loaded and fired using only one hand instead of two.

Special. The force with which you shoot a blowgun needle depends on your exhalation power and lung capacity. When you use ammunition to make a ranged weapon attack with this blowgun, you can add your Constitution modifier to the damage roll instead of your Dexterity modifier.

https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Pillar_(5e_Equipment)
https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Oversized_(5e_Variant_Rule)

#### Variant Rule: Oversized Weapons
A weapon with the **oversized** property is an intermediate step between the Medium-sized weapons from the Player's Handbook and Large-sized weapons (DMG p. 278). The intent is that they can be used by Large-sized player characters in place of a Large-sized weapon, so they can deal the expected extra damage without being overpowered.

##### Creating Oversized Weapons
An oversized weapon is any weapon that has the oversized property applied to it. Follow the below guidelines when creating an oversized weapon: 

***Damage.*** Increase the damage dealt by the weapon by one die size:
- 1 → 1d4 → 1d6 → 1d8 → 1d10 → 1d12 → 2d8
- 2d4 → 2d6 → 2d8

***Weapon Properties.*** 
___
- ***Light.***

***Other properties***
Light. The weapon is only considered light if you are a Large creature, otherwise it is ignored.
Finesse. The weapon is only considered finesse if you are a Large creature, otherwise it is ignored.
Versatile. The weapon is only considered versatile if you are a Large creature, otherwise it is considered to be a two-handed weapon.
Heavy. If you are a Medium creature, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with the weapon. If you are Small, you cannot wield the weapon at all.
Thrown. You can only throw the weapon if you are Large.
Two-handed. Add the heavy property if it did not already have it.

Weight and Cost
Quadruple the weight and cost of the weapon, and of any ammunition it uses.

Oversized unarmed strike?
Yes, works as above; a Large creature deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage with an unarmed strike.

Other sized PCs
Some homebrew feats and class features may allow a PC to wield an oversized weapon as if they were one size category larger. As an errata for these feats and features, the following is in effect:

These effects do not have compounding effects unless otherwise stated.
For medium-sized creatures, this effect applies to weapons only; it does not increase the damage of their unarmed strikes unless otherwise stated.
For small-sized creatures, they may not wield oversized weapons as if they were large, but may wield any weapon as if they were medium sized. Similarly, tiny sized creatures may be treated as small. In both cases, this effect is optional, and there is no penalty for tiny sized creatures who still wish to wield an undersized weapon.
For already large-sized creatures, this has no effect. However, with GM discretion, a "doubly-oversized" weapon variant may be created that they are allowed to wield.
What about Large weapons?
Large weapons deal double the damage dice (e.g. a Large shortsword deals 2d6 damage). Note that this rule is buried away in the "Creating a Monster" chapter of the DMG, and not the PHB. This rule is a guide to help a DM create monsters, so the DM should not feel obligated to allow the same rule to apply to PCs. Nonetheless, a DM might allow a PC to wield a Large weapon as-is; or allow them to wield it with disadvantage on attack rolls (as though it were Heavy for them).

Examples
Greatspear
An oversized spear costs 2 gp and weighs 6 lb.
When wielded by a Large creature: 1d8 piercing, thrown (20/60), versatile (1d10)
When wielded by a Small or Medium creature: 1d8 piercing, two-handed
Buster Sword, or Fullblade
An oversized greatsword costs 100 gp and weighs 12 lb.
When wielded by a Large creature: 2d8 slashing, heavy, two-handed
When wielded by a Medium creature: 2d8 slashing, heavy, two-handed; disadvantage on attack rolls
A small creature cannot wield this.
Guan Do
An oversized glaive costs 40 gp and weighs 12 lb.
When wielded by a Large creature: 1d12 slashing, heavy, reach, two-handed
When wielded by a Medium Creature: 1d12 slashing, heavy, reach, two-handed; disadvantage on attack rolls
A small creature cannot wield this.
Mini Ballista
An oversized heavy crossbow costs 100 gp and weighs 36 lb.
When wielded by a Large creature: 1d12 piercing, ammunition (range 100/400), heavy, loading, two-handed
When wielded by a Medium creature: 1d12 piercing, ammunition (range 100/400), heavy, loading, two-handed; disadvantage on attack rolls
A small creature cannot wield this.
Nodachi, or Ōdachi

When wielded by a Large creature: 1d10 slashing, versatile (1d12); finesse while wielded in one hand
When wielded by a Small or Medium creature: 1d10 slashing, two-handed
Oversized Dagger
An oversized dagger costs 4 gp and weighs 2 lb.
When wielded by a Large creature: 1d6 piercing, finesse, light, thrown (range 20/60)
When wielded by a Small or Medium creature: 1d6 piercing
Oversized Longbow
An oversized longbow costs 100 gp and weighs 4 lb.
When wielded by a Large creature: 1d10 piercing, ammunition (range 150/600), heavy, two-handed
When wielded by a Medium creature: 1d10 piercing, ammunition (range 150/600), heavy, two-handed; disadvantage on attack rolls
A small creature cannot wield this.

Wealth appears in many forms in Tamriel. Coins, gemstones, trade goods, art objects, animals, and property can reflect your character’s financial well-being. Members of the peasantry trade in goods, bartering for what they need and paying taxes in grain and cheese.

Members of the nobility trade either in legal rights, such as the rights to a mine, a port, or farmland, or in gold bars, measuring gold by the pound rather than by the coin. Only merchants, adventurers, and those offering professional services for hire commonly deal in coins.

Coinage
Instead of copper, silver, electrum, and gold coins the land of Tamriel deals only in Septims, which are sometimes called Drakes. When translating prices in gold pieces from 5e to Septims, 1 gold piece is equal to 4 Septims.

A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

Wealth
The economy of Tamriel is based mainly on bartering. Although many merchants deal in coin, many will trade for goods and jewels. Larger cities may refuse to barter for goods and wish to deal strictly in Septims.

Further information: Equipment
Currency
The main currency in Tamriel is the Septim. It is named that way from the Septim Empire that ruled Tamriel from the end of the Second Era until the end of the Third Era. It's called this due to the bust of Tiber Septim on the face of the coin. It is also sometimes referred to as Drakes, due to the seal of Akatosh on the back side.

Fishing Rod (5e Equipment)
https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Fishing_Rod_(5e_Equipment)
Fishing Rod
Simple Melee Weapons
Weapon	Cost	Damage	Weight	Properties
Fishing Rod	20 gp	1 piercing	3 lb.	two-handed, finesse, reach, range (20/60), spooled (60 feet), Special
A sturdy flexible rod of wood or metal, with a reel connected to a strong thin line with a hook on the end. This rod functions as a higher-quality replacement for a simpler rod that might be found as part of a set of fishing tackle.

Special. When a creature takes the piercing damage from an attack made with this weapon, it becomes stuck with the hook and tethered to the rod out to the distance of the spooled line. On its turn, the tethered creature or another creature can use its action to attempt a DC 10 Strength (Medicine) check, taking the weapon's piercing damage from pulling out the hook on a success and ending the tethered condition.

While a Medium or smaller creature is tethered, you can use an action to attempt to reel the line in. You make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the creature’s Strength (Athletics) check. If the creature fails the check, you pull the creature up to your Strength score in feet toward you. If the creature succeeds the check, it is not pulled.

Dealing 2 slashing damage to the line (AC 15) frees the tethered creature without harming it and breaks the line. The line is either also broken or the rod is dropped by you (your choice) if a tethered creature rolls a 15 or higher on the contested Strength (Athletics) check.

Esoteric Weapon. You don't have proficiency with the fishing rod unless you are specifically stated to have proficiency in it, or if you have proficiency in improvised weapons.

Weapon Mastery: Vex. If you are using weapon masteries, the fishing pole has the Vex weapon mastery.
