You light all non-magical light sources in the area that use fire to provide their light—such as candles, lamps, and sconces. You can choose to make the emanation smaller than its maximum, to any distance of your choice. If a light source is attended by an unwilling creature, that creature can attempt a Reflex save to snuff the light out before it becomes noticeable.

You're surrounded by orchestral music that shifts and changes to match your behavior. This music provides a +1 status bonus to Performance checks. At the GM's discretion, it provides this bonus to Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation checks as the music changes to support you in social situations, though some creatures are unaffected by such obvious attempts to use music to illicit specific emotions. This music moves with you and has a maximum volume equal to four humans shouting. You take a –4 penalty to Stealth checks while the music is playing. You can't control the exact music this spell creates. The music doesn't create intelligible words or singing. You can Dismiss this spell. [Source](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1289)

#### Benediction

#### Diabolism
*Necromancy cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Up to 1 hour
___
This spell channels a small amount of dark energy. You create one of the following magical effects within range:
- Choose a point within 30 feet. In a 5-foot radius of that point, bright light becomes dim light, and dim light becomes darkness for 1 hour. Any light sources within the area have the light they produce suppressed for the duration.
- An object up to 1 cubic foot in size or an area up to 1 square foot that you touch lightly decays. Wood rots, glass cracks, flowers wilt. Casting the spell and then continuing to touch the target advances the decay; after 1 minute, the target is destroyed. This spell cannot affect creatures, magical objects, or sturdy materials like metal and stone.
- You can reanimate a Tiny 0 CR beast for 1 hour. It is undead and obeys all of your commands to the best of it's abilities, though it cannot attack. You cannot use this effect again until the reanimated creature dies, or the effect ends.
- You instantaneously light a candle, torch, or small campfire. The fire glows your choice of a smoldering red, bright green, or shadowy purple until extinguished.
- Your fingertip glows red, green, or purple for up to 1 minute. While it glows, you can use your finger to draw glowing lines of the same color on a solid surface that last for 1 hour.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

#### Druidcraft
*Transmutation cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following effects within range:

- You create a tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. The effect might manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 round.
- You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom.
- You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube.
- You instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.

You gain general insights into the immediate vicinity by sending your sense through the root systems of trees and bushes. If there are any unnoticed Medium or larger creatures in the area, you learn of their presence and they're undetected to you. You can immediately attempt to Seek an undetected creature, and you gain a +1 status bonus to this attempt and any of your other attempts to Seek hidden or undetected creatures until the end of your next turn. You also learn if any such creatures passed through this area in the last hour, although you get only the vaguest sense of direction from the spell. If you begin to Track a creature detected in this way, you gain a +1 status bonus to the initial check. [Source](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1409)

As you make comforting sounds and gestures, you approach the target in a friendly manner combining caution and confidence. You improve the target's attitude to you by one step (unfriendly to neutral, neutral to friendly, friendly to helpful) for the duration of the spell unless it succeeds at a Will save. Afterward, the target is temporarily immune for 1 day.

This spell works on only domesticated animals; for example, you could use it on guard dogs or stray dogs, but not feral dogs or wolves. If the socialization of the animal is in question, the decision is up to the GM. [Source](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1014)

#### Invoke Elements
*Transmutation cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Up to 1 minute
___
You invoke a minor portion of the elements. You create one of the following magical effects within range:

 - You create a harmless sensory effect that predicts what the weather will be for the next 24 hours. This effect persists for 1 round.
 - You light or put out a small flame.
 - You cause flames to flicker, brighten, drim, or change color for 1 minute.
 - You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.
 - You cool or heat up a small amount of liquid.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

You draw water out of an object, possibly to clean up spills or quickly dry a soaked book or shirt. You draw up to a pint of water from the object; this dries objects of less than 1 Bulk. The water collects in a globule floating in your hand, which you can direct into a nearby container as part of Casting the Spell; otherwise, it splashes to the ground. Repeated applications of draw moisture can be used to dry larger objects, although doing so might take significant time. You can use this spell in especially humid environments to condense drinkable water from the air, though typically, you can't draw more than a few cups before depleting the ambient moisture. [Source](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1387)

---

You consume and ingest fire, making it less harmful to you. You gain resistance 5 to fire damage until the end of the current turn. During the remaining duration of the spell, you can use the Belch Smoke action. The spell ends if you fall unconscious, inhale, or exhale (this includes speaking). 

Belch Smoke [one-action] You exhale what remains of the smoke, ending the spell and creating a smoke cloud in a 5-foot burst within 20 feet. All creatures within the smoke cloud are concealed, and all other creatures are concealed to them. The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dispersed by a strong wind. [Source](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1352)

Wind flows from your outstretched hands and whirls around you in a 5-foot emanation. Each creature in the area takes bludgeoning damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, with a Fortitude save. [Source](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=917)

---

You purify some dirt or mud into a pliable, claylike plaster that can aid in clotting and healing. This restorative substance can be used in lieu of healer's tools for Medicine checks to Administer First Aid or Treat Wounds. If the plaster isn't used within the spell's duration, or if you Cast the Spell again before using the plaster, it reverts to being normal non-magical earth. [Source](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=925)

---

You cause a splash of cold water to descend on an ally's head, granting some temporary vigor. The target gains 1d4 temporary Hit Points, which last for 1 minute. The target is then temporarily immune to the temporary Hit Points from rousing splash for 10 minutes. The target can also attempt an immediate flat check to recover from a single source of persistent acid or fire damage, with the DC reduction from appropriate assistance. [Source](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1395)

---

You evoke a jumble of rocks in the area. The scattering rocks deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier to creatures in the area, with a basic Reflex save. The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. A creature can Interact to clear a square of this scree.

If you cast this spell again, any previous scatter scree you have cast ends. [Source](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=990)

--- 

Water blasts upward, coming out of the ground, rising from a pool, or even manifesting from thin air. Any creatures in the area take bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier, with a basic Reflex saving throw.

You can change this spell's area to a 5-foot burst, provided you center the burst in a body of water. This body of water can be as small as a pond or creek, but not as small as a puddle or bathtub. [Source](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1002)

---

You slash your hand through the air, channeling miniature ripples of air from each finger to slice your enemy. If you have two hands free, you can target two creatures with this spell; otherwise, you target one.

Make a spell attack roll against each target's AC. This deals 2d4 slashing damage. On a critical success, a target also takes 1d4 persistent bleed damage. If you're attacking two creatures, this counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after both attacks. [Source](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1321)

---

You send a series of tremors, no longer than a short sentence of speech, toward your target. If the target is within range and connected to the same body of earth as you, the vibrations reach the target through the ground. You need neither line of sight nor line of effect, so a target on another floor of a building is a valid target.

The target can give a brief, vibrational response as a reaction, or as a free action on their next turn, but they must be within range to do so. If they respond, their response is delivered to you through tremors you feel, as with the original message. The tremors impart a clear meaning only if you and the target know that meaning, such as three tremors for a specific warning, two for another. Neither of you can impart a nuanced or new meaning using this spell.

A creature that has tremorsense can feel the vibrations from this spell if the creature is within range of the vibrations at any point during their journey to any target. [Source](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1342)

#### Maleficium

#### Prestidigitation
*Transmutation cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Up to 1 hour
---
This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:

- You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
- You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
- You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
- You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
- You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.
- You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

The simplest magic does your bidding. You can perform simple magical effects for as long as you Sustain the Spell. Each time you Sustain the Spell, you can choose one of four options.
Cook Cool, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.
Lift Slowly lift an unattended object of light Bulk or less 1 foot off the ground.
Make Create a temporary object of negligible Bulk, made of congealed magical substance. The object looks crude and artificial and is extremely fragile—it can't be used as a tool, weapon, or spell component.
Tidy Color, clean, or soil an object of light Bulk or less. You can affect an object of 1 Bulk with 10 rounds of concentration, and a larger object a 1 minute per Bulk.
Prestidigitation can't deal damage or cause adverse conditions. Any actual change to an object (beyond what is noted above) persists only as long as you Sustain the Spell.

---

When you Cast the Spell, you gain a perfect sense of time. You can learn exactly what time it is, down to the second. You can instead choose to gain a perfect sense of the calendar if you have knowledge in that area—if you're trained in Nature, you can learn exactly how long it is until sunrise and how many days until the next solstice. If you're trained in Astronomy Lore, you can learn precisely when any known predictable astronomical conjunction will begin and end, and so on.

You can gain a +1 status bonus to one attack roll, Perception check, saving throw, or skill check you take on the same turn you cast time sense that requires extremely precise timing. If you choose to gain this bonus, you can't gain it again for 1 hour. [Source](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1193)

- Your voice booms up to three times as loud as normal for 1 minute.
- You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute.
- You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.
- You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of a raven, or ominous whispers.
- You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut.
- You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

___
Frozen chunks of ice plummet to the ground at seven different points you can see within range. Each creature within a 5-foot-radius of each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Any creature that fails its saving throw is also knocked prone. A creature in the area of more than one frozen burst is affected only once. 

The spell damages objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried, and extinguishes nonmagical flames. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, you summon an additional comet for each slot level above 7th.

- One Medium or smaller creature that you choose must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 5 feet away from you.
- You create a small blast of air capable of moving one object that is neither held nor carried and that weighs no more than 5 pounds. The object is pushed up to 10 feet away from you. It isn't pushed with enough force to cause damage.

You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

- If you target an area of loose earth, you can instantaneously excavate it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up to 5 feet away. This movement doesn't involve enough force to cause damage.
- You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns. The changes last for 1 hour.
- If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain. This change lasts for 1 hour.

- You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube.
- You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour.
