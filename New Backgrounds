## Backgrounds
Every story has a beginning. Your character's background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your warrior might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your mage could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.

Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character's identity. The most important question to ask about your background is *what changed?* Why did you stop doing whatever your back-ground describes and start adventuring? Where did you <br>get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don't you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?

Some of the backgrounds in this chapter are new and are meant as additions to other existing backgrounds. Additionally, there are a number of entries meant to give examples of how certain backgrounds detailed elsewhere might fit into the Warcraft setting. Neither is meant as an absolute list; feel free to work with your DM to select or create a background that fits the character you envision. See the Backgrounds table for the list of backgrounds that are listed in other published books.

#### Proficiencies
Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills. Skills are described in chapter 6 of the Player's Handbook.

In addition, most backgrounds give a character profi-ciency with one or more tools. Tools and tool proficiencies are detailed in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook.

If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different profi-ciency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.

#### Languages
Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race. See "Languages" earlier in this chapter.

#### Equipment
Each background provides a package of starting equip-ment. if you use the optional rule from chapter 4 to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.

#### Suggested Characteristics
A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the sugges-tions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation.

#### Customizing a Background
You might want to tweak some of the features of a back-ground so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. 

You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in chapter 4. (If you spend coin, you can't also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can't find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your DM to create one.

### Acolyte
You have spent your life in service to a specific faith, operating as a member of the clergy. 

The Church of the Holy Light is the most common faith among Ironforge dwarves, high elves, humans, and gnomes. Exodar and lightforged draenei typically serve the Light directly through the teachings of the Naaru. Night elves revere Elune and their Priestesses of the Moon are feared and respected. Pandaren monk-priests are common in Pandaria, following the teachings of a particular August Celestial.

Shamanism and reverence of ancestors is common among most primitive and Horde races. The trolls in particular worship the mysterious Loa spirits.
