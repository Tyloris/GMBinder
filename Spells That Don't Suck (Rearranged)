# Spells That Don't Suck
<div class='wide' style="line-height:1.25em;">
This is a collection of new spells for 5th Edition, made as a joint project between somanyrobots & Omega Ankh. Each is a rebalanced version of an existing spell — some in the SRD, some not. They're also free to use — everything in this document is licensed CC-BY. The license is linked at the bottom, but broadly that means you can incorporate it into your own work (even commercial projects) and share it freely, as long as you credit the authors. Happy casting!

# Spells

#### Adaptation
*2nd-level transmutation*  
___
* **Classes:** Sorcerer, Wizard  
* **Casting Time:** 1 action  
* **Range:** Touch  
* **Components:** V, S  
* **Duration:** 1 hour
* **Replaces:** *Alter Self*
___
You touch a creature, modifying it for a specific environment. The target chooses one of the following options for the duration. It can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.

* The creature grows gills and webbing between its digits. It can breathe underwater and gains a swimming speed equal to its walking speed.  
* The creature grows a membrane between its limbs. When the creature falls, it can use its reaction to subtract up to 100 feet from the fall when calculating falling damage and can glide horizontally a number of feet equal to its walking speed.  
* The creature grows a prehensile tail. The tail has a 5-foot reach and can lift a number of pounds equal to five times the creature’s Strength score. It can grasp, lift, drop, hold, push, or pull an object or a creature, open or close a door or a container, grapple someone, or make an unarmed strike.  
* The creature’s appearance changes. For the duration, it can use an action to change its height, weight, facial features, voice, hair length and coloration, and distinguishing characteristics. It cannot change its size or number of limbs.  
* The creature grows a natural weapon. Unarmed strikes with the weapon deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage as appropriate. The natural weapon is magical and has a \+1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the natural weapon’s bonus increases to +2. When you use a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the natural weapon’s bonus increases to +3. Additionally, the target can select one additional option for every two slot levels above 2nd.

\columnbreak

#### Alter Weather
*6th-level transmutation*
___
- **Classes:** Cleric, Druid, Wizard
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (1-mile radius)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a silver dish and a glass tube filled with quicksilver)
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Replaces:** *Control Weather*
___
You seize the air currents above you, taking control of the local weather. You must have clear sight of the sky to cast this spell, and the spell ends early if you end your turn unable to see it.

When you cast the spell, you can choose to shift the precipitation, temperature, and wind each by one stage on the charts below. It takes 30 minutes for the conditions to change, after which you can change them again. The charts suggest weather effects, and your GM may determine any additional effects resulting from the change in weather. Your GM may rule that fire or cold resistance, hot or cold weather gear, or other measures partly or completely protect a creature against the effects. After the spell ends, the weather returns to its original state, changing at the same rate. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.

##### Precipitation

Higher stages include all the effects of lower stages.

| Stage | Condition  | Effects  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Clear | —  |
| 2 | Light Clouds | —  |
| 3 | Overcast or ground fog | The area lacks sunlight, for effects or traits dependent on it. |
| 4 | Rain, hail, or snow | Objects and creatures are lightly obscured more than 60 feet away. |
| 5 | Torrential rain, driving hail, or blizzard | Objects and creatures are heavily obscured more than 30 feet away, and all terrain is difficult terrain. |

\pagebreakNum

##### Temperature

Stage 1 includes the effects of stage 2, and stage 7 includes the effects of stage 6\.

| Stage | Condition | Effects |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Unbearable Heat | All creatures must pass a DC 10 Constitution saving throw every hour or suffer one level of exhaustion. |
| 2 | Hot  | All creatures suffer disadvantage on all Constitution saves except against weather effects. |
| 3 | Warm | —  |
| 4 | Pleasant | —  |
| 5 | Cool | —  |
| 6 | Cold | All creatures suffer disadvantage on Dexterity checks. |
| 7 | Bitter Cold | All creatures must pass a DC 10 Constitution saving throw every hour or suffer one level of exhaustion. |

##### Wind

Higher stages include all the effects of lower stages.

| Stage | Condition | Effects |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Calm  | —  |
| 2 | Moderate wind  | —  |
| 3 | Strong wind | Ranged attacks are made at disadvantage. |
| 4 | Windstorm  | All creatures have resistance to damage from ranged attacks |
| 5 | Hurricane  | Ranged attacks are impossible, and all movement against the wind costs twice as much. |

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level, the duration is 8 hours, and the area increases to a 5-mile radius. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level, the duration is 24 hours, and the area increases to a 10-mile radius. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the duration is 7 days, and the area increases to a 25-mile radius.

\columnbreak

#### Animal Ally
*2nd-level enchantment*
___
- **Classes:** Druid, Ranger
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a biscuit baked out of meat and grain)
- **Duration:** Concentration, 1 hour
- **Replaces:** *Beast Bond & Beast Sense*
___
You connect your mind to that of a friendly beast within range. You can use your action to use its senses instead of your own until the start of your next turn. While the beast is within 120 feet of you, you and the beast can communicate telepathically, and the beast gains the following benefits:

* The beast can add your proficiency bonus to all of its ability checks.  
* The beast deals an extra 1d6 damage to a target whenever it hits with an attack  
* The beast has advantage on attack rolls against any creature you have attacked since the start of your last turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the spell’s duration increases to 8 hours. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell’s duration increases to 24 hours.

#### Animal Transformation
*4th-level transmutation*
___
- **Classes:** Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a lump of clay)
- **Duration:** Concentration, 1 hour
- **Replaces:** *Polymorph*
___
You gesture at a creature you can see within range, magically molding them into a new form. The spell has no effect on a creature with 0 hit points. An unwilling creature must make a Charisma saving throw or be transformed. At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can repeat the save, ending the spell on a success.

The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s challenge rating or level, but no greater than 4\. The target’s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment, personality, allegiances, and broad plan of action.

The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech. Its items meld into the new form, and the creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of it.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the new form’s maximum challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 4th.

\pagebreakNum

#### Arcane Shelter
*3rd-level abjuration (ritual)*
___
- **Classes:** Bard, Wizard
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Self (10-foot dome)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a flake of tortoise shell)
- **Duration:** 8 hours
- **Replaces:** *Tiny Hut*
___
You construct a 10-foot radius dome of arcane energy, centered on yourself. The dome is stationary and disappears if you exit its area. If you cast it in a location without enough space to accommodate it, the spell fails.

Ten Medium creatures can fit inside the dome; a Large creature takes as much space as four Medium creatures. You can designate up to ten creatures when you cast the spell who can freely pass in and out of the dome, spending 25 feet of movement to move through the dome. Other creatures cannot pass through.

The dome is translucent, with only vague shapes visible through it. Projectiles that touch the dome are slowed to a stop, and spells and other magical effects can’t pass through the dome or be cast through it.

#### Arcane Wall
*5th-level evocation*
___
- **Classes:** Wizard
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powdered gemstone)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Replaces:** *Wall of Force*
___
An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).

Nothing can physically pass through the wall. Each panel has AC 15 and 100 hit points. The wall can’t be dispelled by dispel magic, and is immune to psychic and nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. A disintegrate spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.

\columnbreak

#### Arcanist's Sword
*7th-level evocation*
___
- **Classes:** Wizard, Bard
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of copper and zinc, worth 250 gp)
- **Duration:**  1 minute
- **Replaces:** *Mordenkainen's Sword*
___
You create a glowing sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range for the duration. When the sword appears and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can give the sword one of the following commands.

* **Attack**. The sword moves up to 20 feet toward a creature and makes a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 3d10 + your spellcasting ability modifier.  
* **Guard**. The sword moves up to 20 feet into a creature’s space and grants the creature half cover as it attempts to deflect incoming attacks. The first time a hostile creature comes within 5 feet of the sword, the sword makes a melee spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 3d10 + your spellcasting ability modifier. The sword cannot attack again until you command it again.  
* **Whirl**. The sword moves up to 20 feet toward a point and then begins to spin in a deadly whirl. A creature that starts in the sword’s space or passes within 5 feet of the sword on its turn must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d10 force damage.

#### Arctic Breath
*1st-level evocation*
___
- **Classes:** Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot line)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Replaces:** *Frost Fingers*
___
A line of freezing arctic wind 30 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction of your choice. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 2d8 cold damage and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t slowed.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

\pagebreakNum

#### Assemble
*4th-level transmutation*
___
- **Classes:** Wizard
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Replaces:** *Fabricate*
___
You magically assemble unfinished materials you can see within range that are not being worn or carried into products. With enough unfinished material, you can assemble up to eight nonmagical objects. A Large object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes) counts as eight, a Medium or Small object as one, and a Tiny object as one-eighth. The object cannot be securely attached to a surface or a larger object, and if you are working with metal or stone, the assembled object can be no larger than Medium. Unfinished materials can be raw (freshly felled trees or mined ores) or partly-worked (wooden boards or metal ingots), but cannot be finished goods (a constructed building or suit of armor). Examples include:

* Metals and alloys (such as bronze, iron, or silver)  
* Organic byproducts (such as canvas, silk, or wool)  
* Plant matter (such as flax, hemp, or oak)  
* Stone (such as granite, marble, or sandstone)

You cannot affect creatures or magic items, and you must have proficiency in the appropriate set of artisan’s tools to create items of commensurate craftsmanship. For this type of artisanal crafting, the spell completes the equivalent of eight hours’ work, which can be part of a longer-term project.

#### Aura of Concealment
*2nd-level abjuration*
___
- **Classes:** Druid, Ranger
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot radius)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of ash and a cotton bud)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Replaces:** *Pass without Trace*
___
You radiate concealing magic in an aura with a 30-foot radius, making you and your allies more difficult to detect. Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you choose within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity (Stealth) check, the creature may add a \+5 bonus. A chosen creature leaves no trace of its passage and cannot be tracked except by magical means.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the bonus increases by 1 for each slot level above 2nd.

> In most situations where Aura of Concealment is appropriate, the party will be making group stealth checks against an enemy's passive Perception. It's strongly recommended that GMs run those as written in the basic rules. Some GMs require every PC to succeed, or roll active Perception for each enemy — either option will artificially inflate the check's difficulty.

\columnbreak

#### Aura of Truth
*2nd-level enchantment*
___
- **Classes:** Bard, Cleric, Paladin
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot radius)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Replaces:** *Zone of Truth*
___
You radiate a compulsion for honesty in an aura with a 15-foot radius. Until the spell ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you. The first time a creature ends its turn within the area, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it cannot intentionally lie while in the aura. A creature can choose to fail its save, and you know if a creature succeeds or fails. An affected creature is aware of the spell and can answer evasively.

As an action, you can focus the spell to compel answers. You may ask up to two yes-or-no questions, each directed at an affected creature, who must answer truthfully. The spell then ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the aura’s radius increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 2nd. Additionally, the number of compelled questions you can ask increases by 1 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Beast Perception
*2nd-level divination*
___
- **Classes:** Druid, Ranger
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S, M (a tuft of fur, feathers, or dried skin of the beast the spell mimics)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Replaces:** *Beast Sense* (in part)
___
When you cast the spell, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.

* **Darkvision.** You gain darkvision out to 30 feet.  
* **Echolocation.** You gain blindsight out to 10 feet, but only if you continuously make high-pitched sounds, preventing you from speaking normally while you do. Your squeaking can be heard from up to 60 feet away.  
* **Keen Hearing.** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.  
* **Keen Sight.** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.  
* **Keen Smell.** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.  
* **Tremorsense.** You gain tremorsense out to 30 feet.  
* **Websense.** While in contact with a web, you know the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

\pagebreakNum

#### Befriend
*Enchantment cantrip*
___
- **Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** S, M (1 copper piece, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Replaces:** *Friends*
___
You ensorcel one creature you can see within range, compelling them to like and trust you. For the duration, you have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) checks to interact with the target. Afterward, the target is aware you magically influenced it, and becomes hostile toward you. A violent creature might attack you, while others might spread word of your treachery, summon the authorities, or otherwise attempt to thwart you.

#### Befriend Beast
*1st-level enchantment (ritual)*
___
- **Classes:** Bard, Druid, Ranger
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a biscuit baked out of meat and grain)
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Replaces:** *Animal Friendship & Animal Messenger*
___
You magically persuade a beast that you are a trusted ally. Choose a beast that you can see within range, which must be able to see and hear you. The beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the spell’s duration. Beasts with Intelligence 4 or higher automatically succeed. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spell ends.

While charmed in this way, the beast is willing to perform simple tasks on your behalf, including scouting locations, finding things, or delivering objects. If asked to deliver a message, it can understand locations and a general description of a target, though it cannot reliably find an individual. A beast delivering a message typically covers 1 mile per hour walking, or 2 miles per hour if it can fly.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level, the duration of the spell increases to 24 hours. If you use a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can either increase the duration by another 24 hours for each slot level above 2nd or affect one additional beast for each slot level above 2nd.

\columnbreak

#### Benediction
*Divination cantrip*
___
- **Classes:** Cleric, Druid
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Replaces:** *Guidance*
___
Magic enhances your words as you advise one creature that can see and understand you within range. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a 1d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the ability check. The spell then ends.

A creature with 4 Intelligence or higher that perceives your spellcasting is aware of its magical influence and responds accordingly.

> Stacking bonus-die buffs can easily break skill checks. The following house rule is strongly recommended: *Only one bonus-die effect (the largest) can be applied to any given d20 roll.*

#### Bewilder
*4th-level enchantment*
___
- **Classes:** Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sprig of wormwood)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Replaces:** *Confusion*
___
You distort and confuse your enemies’ senses, driving them to inexplicable action. Each creature in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.

An affected target can’t take reactions. At the start of each of its turns, it must spend half of its movement to move in a random horizontal direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. It then must roll a d4 to determine its actions. 

| d4 | Behavior |
| :---- | :---- |
| 1 | The creature is stunned until the start of its next turn.  |
| 2 | The creature treats every other creature as its enemy until the start of its next turn, fighting them with its typical tactics. |
| 3 | The creature becomes frightened of every other creature it can see until the start of its next turn. |
| 4 | The creature drops any weapons or items it is holding, and doesn’t move or take actions this turn. |

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can repeat its saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature can also repeat its saving throw any time it takes damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.

___
You cause a patch of nearly transparent ice to form on ground that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the magic ice fills a 5-foot square. Any creature on the ice’s space when you cast the spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 cold damage. If the creature is Medium or smaller, it also falls prone on a failed save.

A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves onto the ice's space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn atop it.

This spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Replaces:** *Daylight*
___
A 60-foot radius sphere of light spreads out from a point you choose within range. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet. This light isn’t sunlight.

If you target a point on an object you are holding or one that isn't being worn or carried, the light shines from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the light.

If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of its own level or lower, or an equivalent magical effect, the spell or effect that created the darkness is dispelled.

#### Burst of Flame

___
- **Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Replaces:** *Pyrotechnics*
___
You summon up a fiery explosion, creating light, heat, or smoke. You may conjure the explosion at any point within 60 feet, but it will have added effect if you conjure it atop an existing nonmagical flame (extinguishing up to a 5-foot cube of flame). Choose one of the following effects.

* **Light.** You create a shower of sparks, blinding onlookers. Each creature in a 10-foot radius must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn. If you target an existing flame, the radius increases to 20 feet.  
* **Heat.** You conjure a blast of intense heat. Each creature in a 10-foot radius must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 fire damage, or half as much on a successful save. If you target an existing flame, the damage increases to 4d6.  
* **Smoke.** You create a 15-foot radius cloud of thick, oily smoke. It spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. If you target an existing flame, the radius is 30 feet. The cloud lasts for 1 minute or until dispersed by a strong breeze.

#### Call for Aid
*6th-level conjuration*
___
- **Classes:** Cleric
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Replaces:** *Planar Ally*
___
You seek assistance from a mighty extraplanar being — a god, archdevil, or other legendary and powerful creature. It sends one of its loyal servants to aid you, which appears in an unoccupied space within range. 

When the creature appears, it is friendly but under no obligation to help you. It speaks at least one language you speak. It typically demands payment for its aid, in a form appropriate to the creature (for example, tithes for a celestial or sacrifices for a fiend). When payment has monetary value, it usually is 50 gp per minute, 500 gp per hour, or 5,000 gp per day. It may be decreased or increased as much as 50% depending on whether the extraplanar being endorses the task, or on the danger of the task. The cost usually increases when repeatedly summoning the same extraplanar being and may be free the first time if the being favors you.

Services can be anything appropriate to the creature summoned. Creatures will rarely agree to tasks that are suicidal, impossible, abhorrent, or especially lengthy. After the creature completes the task, or you are unable to satisfy its payment, it returns to its home plane.

#### Captivate
*2nd-level enchantment*
___
- **Classes:** Bard, Warlock
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot radius)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Replaces:** *Enthrall*
___
You enact a performance laced with subtle magic, your gestures and voice causing others to focus on you to the exclusion of all else. Creatures you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you. If you or your companions are fighting a creature, it has advantage on the save. While charmed by you in this way, a creature has disadvantage on initiative rolls as well as Wisdom (Perception) checks made to perceive any creature other than you until the spell ends, or until the target can no longer see or hear you.

Additionally, if a creature rolls initiative while affected by this spell, its speed is reduced by 10 feet and it can’t take reactions until after its first turn ends. The spell ends if you are incapacitated or can no longer speak. A creature that fails its saving throw doesn’t realize that you used magic to influence it, even if it witnessed the spell being cast.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration increases by 1 minute and the radius increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Replaces:** *Acid Arrow*
___
You conjure an arrow of acid and send it streaking towards a target within range. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 6d4 acid damage and is coated in acid. An acid-coated target can use its action to wipe the acid off. If not, then at the end of its next turn, it takes an additional 4d4 acid damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, both instances of damage increase by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Circle of Protection
*3rd-level abjuration*

- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Replaces:** *Magic Circle*
___
You draw a 10-foot radius circular glyph upon the ground, which projects upward into a luminous 30-foot tall cylinder. Select one of the following creature types when you draw the glyph: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. A challenge rating 5 or lower creature of the chosen type can’t willingly move across the cylinder's boundary. When the creature attempts to make an attack, cast a spell, use teleportation or interplanar travel, or cause any other effect across the boundary, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.

Whenever you start casting the spell, you can modify it so that it doesn’t require concentration. If you do so, the spell’s casting time becomes 10 minutes for that casting.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the maximum challenge rating of affected creatures increases by 3 for each slot level above 3rd. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th or 6th level, the duration is concentration, up to 12 hours. When cast using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is concentration, up to 24 hours. When cast using a 9th-level spell slot, the spell lasts until dispelled, and there is no challenge rating limit on affected creatures.

- **Components:** S
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
- **Replaces:** *Snilloc's Snowball Swarm*
___
With a snap of your fingers, a swirling burst of freezing wind erupts at a point you choose within range. Each creature in a 5-foot radius sphere must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 3d8 cold damage and becomes coated in ice, reducing its speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. On a success, it takes half as much damage and is not slowed.

The ground in the area is covered with slick ice and snow, making it difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Command Beast
*3rd-level enchantment*
___
- **Classes:** Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Replaces:** *Dominate Beast*
___
You attempt to take control of a beast you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. A beast of challenge rating 4 or higher automatically succeeds on this saving throw. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.

While the beast is charmed, you can issue telepathic commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

As an action, you can take full control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time, any reactions the creature takes require you to use your reaction as well.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 4th level or higher, there is no challenge rating limit to the target creature.

#### Command Objects
*5th-level transmutation*
___
- **Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Replaces:** *Animate Objects*

You magically animate nearby objects, bending them to your will. Choose up to six nonmagical objects within range that are not being worn or carried. All objects must be the same size, and you can animate six Tiny, four Small, three Medium, two Large, or one Huge object(s). Each object animates until spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points; when an object drops to 0 hit points, any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.

##### Command Objects Statistics

| Size | HP | AC | Str | Dex | Damage | Speed |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Tiny | 5 | 19 | 12 | 28 | 1d4 \+ 1 damage | fly 30 (hover) |
| Small | 10 | 18 | 16 | 24 | 1d6 \+ 3 damage | fly 30 |
| Medium | 20 | 17 | 20 | 20 | 1d10 \+ 5 damage | 30 |
| Large | 30 | 16 | 24 | 16 | 2d10 \+ 7 damage | 25 |
| Huge | 60 | 15 | 28 | 12 | 5d12 \+ 9 damage | 20 |

An animated object has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and statistics as shown in the table above. The GM might rule an object has immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific damage types based on its form. If an object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0.

In combat, an object shares your initiative count, but takes its turn immediately after yours.

As a bonus action, you can issue one command to any number of objects within the spell’s range. That command can be to attack, or some other action. Otherwise, the only action an object takes on its turn is the Dodge action. An object may also be commanded to attempt an action available to all creatures, such as grapple or shove, if its form permits it to do so.

If commanded to attack, an object makes one melee attack against a target you specify within 5 feet of it. Its attack bonus is equal to your spell attack modifier. An object usually deals bludgeoning damage, but the GM might rule it deals slashing or piercing damage based on its form.

- **Replaces:** *Burning Hands*
___
Flames shoot forth from your fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success.

The flames ignite any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 and the range of the cone increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 1st.

#### Confinement

- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Replaces:** *Forcecage*
___
An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box as you choose. The prison has an AC of 17 and 140 hit points.

A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side, is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced a 1/2-inch apart, and provides half cover to creatures inside.

A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.

When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.

A creature inside the cage can't leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the magic fails and has no effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.

This spell can't be dispelled by *dispel magic*.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the cage’s AC increases by 1 and its hit points increase by 20 for each slot level above 7th.

___
You pull together wisps of magical energy and sculpt them into beasts. Choose a Small or Tiny beast of challenge rating 1/4 or lower, and eight creatures of that type appear immediately in unoccupied spaces around you. If you choose a beast with a flying speed, you summon six creatures instead. Each beast is considered fey and disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The summoned beasts are friendly to you and your companions. In combat, the beasts share your initiative count, but take their turns immediately after yours. The beasts obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to them, they move as a group and take the Dodge action.

If you command the beasts to attack, choose a target for each beast to attack within its reach, making a single melee spell attack for each target. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 bludgeoning or piercing damage (your choice), plus 1d4 extra damage for each additional beast attacking it. You have advantage on the attack roll if three or more beasts attack the same target, and you add your spellcasting ability modifier to the damage dealt if six or more beasts attack the same target.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you summon two additional beasts for each slot level above 3rd.

You create a floating spirit which conveys a message of your choice. The herald appears to be a Medium or Small creature of ghostly form, with you determining its appearance otherwise. The herald knows a fixed message of up to 25 words. When you cast this spell, choose one of the following effects:

* **Ward.** The herald is cast at a particular location, or on a statue or other object with a mouth, and is fixed to that point. It is invisible and motionless until a specific condition is met within 30 feet of its location. When the condition is met, it appears and recites its message. If cast on an object, it moves the object’s mouth rather than appearing directly. You determine whether it does so once or disappears again and repeats the message every time the condition is met. When cast in this way, the herald lasts until dispelled.  
* **Announcement.** The herald floats through the air up to 100 feet up and 30 feet per round, repeating its message every round. It traverses an area up to a 5-mile radius around its location, conveying its message to every creature it sees. When cast in this way, the herald lasts for 1 hour.

The spell conjures two demons which use the Minor Fiend stat block below. Alternatively, your GM may choose any number of fiends whose combined challenge ratings are 2 or lower. In combat, the fiends share your initiative count but take their turns immediately after yours.

The fiends are friendly to you and your companions and hostile to all other creatures. If you lose concentration on the spell, they do not disappear. Instead, they become hostile toward you and your companions. They can’t be dismissed and last for 1 hour after their summoning. A fiend disappears when reduced to 0 hit points.

- **Replaces:** *Find Traps*
___
You sense the presence of any trap within range. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes any object, terrain, or magic that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a spell glyph, a hidden pit trap, or a natural sinkhole, but not a creature lying in ambush.

The spell reveals the general presence and vague direction of a trap within its 120-foot range, but not its specific location. If you come within 15 feet of the trap, you detect its presence exactly, and any ability checks you or your companions make to examine it are made with advantage.

___
You recite a profane chant to summon a devil, which appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The devil’s challenge rating is at least 4 and no higher than 8\. The GM chooses the devil’s type, and it is under the GM’s control. If you know a devil’s true name or possess its talisman, you can attempt to summon that devil regardless of its challenge rating.

The devil typically resents being summoned but will not harm you for the duration. On each of your turns, you can command it. It obeys orders it considers reasonable and fights ruthlessly, but will retreat to preserve its life and rank.

After 10 minutes, the devil can ignore your commands and might choose to remain and pursue its own goals. You may attempt to reason with, persuade, or strike a deal that aligns with its interests. If you maintain concentration for the full duration, you may return the devil to whence it came, otherwise, it remains summoned indefinitely.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the devil’s possible challenge rating increases by 2 for each slot level above 5th.

The attack deals an extra 5d10 force damage, and the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it is partly phased out of the plane, becoming incapacitated and gaining resistance to all damage until the spell ends,

A creature incapacitated by this spell makes another Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the spell ends.

You create a holy sanctuary dedicated to a specific deity at an empty point on the ground you can see within range. The temple occupies a cube up to 60 feet on each side.

The temple has at least one door and is enclosed by wood and stone floors, walls, and a roof.
You determine all other aspects of its appearance (as long as it conforms to the worship of the deity to which it is devoted) such as altars, idols, illumination, rooms, scent, temperature, and windows.

Divination spells of 6th level and below can't target creatures within the temple or create sensors inside of it.

When you cast the spell, choose one or more of the following creature types for the temple to oppose: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. If such a creature attempts to enter the temple, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it can't enter the temple for 24 hours. On a success, whenever it makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw inside the temple, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the d20 roll.

Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes the temple permanent.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the casting time increases by 1 hour and the temple's size increases by 60 feet on each side for each spell level above 6th. The temple counters divination spells of a level less than or equal to the slot level used.

On a success, it takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects. You regain hit points equal to half the damage dealt. Until the spell ends, you can use your action on each of your turns to repeat the effect against a creature within range.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Replaces:** *Dust Devil*
___
A small cyclone whips up at a point you can see on the ground within range. The cyclone is a 5-foot radius, 30-foot high cylinder centered on that point.

Any creature that starts its turn within the radius of the dust cyclone or enters its radius for the first time during its turn must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d12 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 5 feet away from the center. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed.

As a bonus action, you can move the dust cyclone up to 30 feet in any direction. The first time you pass the dust cyclone through a creature, you can force it to make the saving throw, as if it entered the cyclone’s radius. You can continue to move the dust cyclone, but its strength is exhausted until the end of your turn and subsequent creatures are unaffected by it passing through them.

If the dust cyclone moves over sand, dust, loose dirt, or small gravel, it sucks up the material and heavily obscures its radius until the start of your next turn.

For the duration, you magically command the earth to reshape itself around you. As an action, you can permanently modify up to a 20-foot cube of soft earth you can see within range, such as sand, dirt, or clay, which you can move up to 20 feet over the course of 5 minutes. You can change its elevation or create or destroy trenches, pillars, ramps, walls, or other simple shapes. Because the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s movement. You can choose a new area to modify at any point, though you can only shape one area at a time; an unfinished formation slowly reverts to its original shape.

The spell can’t shape stone, metal, or other hard materials. Rocks, plants, and structures shift or move to accommodate the new terrain, and may become unstable or fall.

When you cast this spell as a ritual, the silver pickaxe must be worth at least 500 gp and is consumed.

An airborne creature takes falling damage as normal, up to a maximum of 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage.

If the terrain is dirt or stone, it becomes difficult terrain for creatures other than you for the next hour.

- **Replaces:** *Symbol*
___
When you cast this spell, you mark a fixed surface with an arcane inscription, occupying a 5-foot diameter circle. When a creature enters the glyph’s space or otherwise disturbs it, the glyph triggers.

You can refine the trigger by specifying or exempting creatures or creature types, or by specifying a password a creature can speak as a reaction to prevent the glyph from triggering.

The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found. A creature has advantage on this check if it is able to perceive magical effects, such as by casting detect magic. If a creature uses its action to destroy the glyph, or the surface is destroyed, the spell ends without triggering.

When you create the glyph, choose one of the options below, expending its material component. When the glyph triggers, it flares with colored light until destroyed. The effect immediately occurs, targeting every non-exempt creature within 60 feet.

***Weakness (Amethyst).*** Each target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, it suffers crippling weakness for 1 hour. Its speed drops to 15 feet, and all its weapon attacks deal damage as if it rolled the minimum result.

***Binding (Topaz).*** Each target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is restrained by magical lines of force for 1 hour.

***Death (Black Sapphire).*** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, dropping to 0 hit points on a failure or suffering 10d8 necrotic damage on a success.

***Bafflement (Citrine).*** Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it loses its ability to understand the world for 1 hour. It cannot cast spells and has disadvantage on all ability checks and attack rolls.

***Rage (Garnet).*** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes hostile to all other creatures and attacks the nearest target. It can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns.

***Stupor (Emerald).*** Each target must make a Charisma saving throw, or enter a dazed state, its mind disconnected from its body. A creature takes no actions, and its speed is reduced by half. It recovers after 1 hour or when it takes any damage.

The wall lasts for the duration. When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d10 bludgeoning damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

At the start of each of your turns after the wall appears, the wall, along with any creatures in it, moves 50 feet along the ground in a direction of your choice. Any Huge or smaller creature inside the wall or whose space the wall enters when it moves must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 5d10 bludgeoning damage. A creature can take this damage only once per round. At the end of the turn, the wall’s height is reduced by 50 feet, and the damage creatures take from the spell on subsequent rounds is reduced by 1d10. When the wall reaches 0 feet in height, the spell ends.

A creature caught in the wall can attempt to swim through it by making a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. If it fails the check, it can’t move. A creature that moves out of the spell’s area falls to the ground.

The spell has no effect on undead or constructs. It can’t cause damage or inflict conditions. The target behaves as if the phantasm is real, and can inspect the phantasm as an action, making an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it is close enough to touch the phantasm, it has advantage on this check. On a success, the spell ends.

As a bonus action while you are within range, you can adjust the phantasm (for instance, moving a creature up to 30 feet, opening a door, or shattering a window.)

Huge creatures can be restrained if targeted with two or more spikes, and Gargantuan creatures with six or more. On a success, a target suffers half as much damage and no other effects.

An impaled target can use its action to attempt to free itself with a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spell save DC. On a success, it is no longer restrained and falls. A target is also freed if all spikes impaling it are destroyed.

Once per turn while charmed in this way, the target's current and maximum hit points are reduced by 5d10 if its behavior contradicts your instructions. This reduction lasts until the spell ends.

You can issue any command you choose, though the spell ends if you issue a suicidal command. The creature's death does not end the spell.

As an action, you can end the spell early. *Remove curse* cast at the spell's level also ends the spell. *Greater restoration* ends the reduction of the target's hit point maximum, but it does not end the spell. This spell can't be dispelled by *dispel magic*.

On a failure, the creature’s hit point maximum is reduced by 7d4, its speed is reduced by 5 feet, and it receives a \-2 penalty to attack rolls, ability checks, saving throws, and save DCs. A creature suffers cumulative effects with each failed saving throw. If a creature fails its saving throw five times, it dies.

All effects caused by this spell (except death) end when the spell ends.

On a hit, the target takes 1d6 lightning damage and is ensnared by the lightning leash. If the target moves outside of the spell’s range before the start of your next turn, you can use your reaction to yank on the leash. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 1d6 lightning damage and have its speed halved until the start of your next turn. Once it is outside of the spell’s range, the leash dissipates.

Both damage rolls increase by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

Any time a creature would damage the double, or perceives the double making an attack or casting a spell, it makes an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, it realizes the double is an illusion and you are no longer invisible to that creature.

As an action, you can use the double’s senses instead of your own until you use your action to return to your normal senses, or until the spell ends. While you do so, you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.

___
You transform up to a 40-foot cube of earth with one of the following effects:

**Create Mud.** Rock and dirt in the area becomes mud for the spell’s duration. Creatures sink into the ground, and each foot that a creature moves costs 4 feet of movement. If a creature is on the ground when you cast the spell, moves into the area for the first time, or ends its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature is restrained. As an action, a restrained target or another creature within 5 feet can end the restrained condition.

**Create Rock.** An area of wet earth less than 10 feet deep becomes rock for the spell’s duration. Any creature standing in the mixture when it hardens must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, a creature moves to an unoccupied space on the rock’s surface. On a failure, a creature is restrained. As an action, a restrained target or another creature within 5 feet can end the restrained condition by succeeding on a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.

It can immediately grab at a Large or smaller creature within 5 feet, forcing the target to make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target becomes restrained and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.

As long as the mud golem is within 30 feet of you, you can mentally command it as an action. If it is restraining a target, you can command it to squeeze. The target makes a Strength saving throw, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. Alternatively, you can command the golem to dissolve and reform (with full hit points, even if it has been destroyed) anywhere within the spell’s range and attempt to grab a creature within 5 feet. You can order the golem to let go of a creature at any time (no action required).

To break out, a restrained target can use its action to attempt a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spell save DC. On a success, it is no longer restrained.

Any creature within 5 feet of a restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC, ending the effect on a success.  
* **Rocks.** You conjure a boulder and hurl it at a creature. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 6d10 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone if it is Large or smaller.  
* **Wind.** You summon a mighty gust. The gust takes the shape of a line 60 feet long and 20 feet wide, originating at a location you can see and traveling in a direction of your choice.

If a creature is killed by this spell, the blast spreads, affecting a 10-foot radius around that creature as well. A creature cannot be damaged twice by the spell, and the spell ends after damaging 10 creatures.

If a humanoid dies from this spell, it rises as a zombie at the start of your next turn and attacks the closest living creature.

Additionally, you have perfect knowledge of the target’s location as long as you are on the same plane of existence. The target can’t be hidden from you and gains no benefit from the invisible condition against you.

- **Duration:** Permanent
- **Replaces:** *Imprisonment*
___
You prepare a magical prison, trapping a creature you can see within range for eternity. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be imprisoned. On a success, it is immune to this spell for 1 year. While imprisoned in this way, the target does not age, does not need to eat, breathe, or drink, and cannot be found by any divination magic. You select the form of the prison when you cast the spell. Common options would be a sealed demiplane, miniaturized within a gemstone, or trapped in a cavity deep below the ground.

When you cast the spell, you must specify the condition by which the target can be freed. The condition can be as elaborate or as specific as you desire, but it must be reasonable and possible (your GM must approve the condition). The condition can involve a creature’s name, identity, or characteristics, but not game concepts such as level, class, or hit points. *Dispel magic* cannot free the target.

You pen a secret message on a parchment, paper, or other writing material.

Alternatively, you can specify a creature. The message automatically appears when it holds the parchment. You can write any other text on the parchment, which becomes invisible anytime the secret message is displayed. When the spell ends, the secret message disappears forever.

Creatures with truesight can see the secret message. A *dispel magic* cast on the parchment ends the spell without revealing the secret message.

The spell’s duration is related to the quality of ink used. Magical ink worth 10 gp gives it a duration of 10 days. More expensive ink lasts an additional day for each 1 gp spent; if 100 gp worth of magical ink is used, the duration becomes permanent.

The effect persists until the spell ends, or until you use your action to pause it or change it to a different effect. You can resume a paused effect as an action.

**Gale.** A steady wind blows in a horizontal direction of your choice. Every foot of movement against the wind costs 2 extra feet, and ranged attacks made against the wind automatically miss. Creatures moving with the wind can move 1 extra foot for each foot of movement spent. When a creature or projectile moves within the area, you can use your reaction to change the wind’s direction. As a bonus action, you can create a gust. All creatures within the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 30 feet in the wind’s direction.

**Turbulence.** You whip the wind into a chaotic vortex. Ranged attacks passing through the wind are made with disadvantage. Any creature that flies into the wind's area, starts its turn flying there, or takes flight there has its flying speed halved, and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

It can only take the most instinctive actions, such as fighting with unarmed strikes or natural weapons, or running away in a straight line. It can’t cast spells, activate magic items, understand language, use weapons or tools, or communicate in any way. It can understand when another creature means it harm.

After one day has passed, a creature can repeat its saving throw, ending the spell on a success. Each time it fails the saving throw, it adds one additional day onto the time interval before it can repeat its save.

The spell can also be ended by *greater restoration*, *heal*, or *wish*.

The first time a creature sees the omen, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. A creature can choose to fail its saving throw if it interprets the omen positively. On a failure, it suffers one of the following effects (or another appropriate effect upon its confidence or morale, as determined by the GM). At the end of every day, a creature can repeat its saving throw against this spell.

| | |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Terror** | A creature failing the save is frightened of the omen. |

If there is not enough space at the destination, it is left behind.

After you teleport, the rift closes and emits a sonic shockwave. Choose either your starting or ending space. All creatures within 10 feet of that space except you and any creature you brought with you must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d8 thunder damage on a failure or half as much damage on a success.

- **Duration:** Until dispelled
- **Replaces:** *Magic Jar*
___
Your body falls unconscious as your soul enters the spell’s material component. You perceive from the component using your senses, but can’t move or use reactions. You can only use your action to project your soul up to 100 feet, either to return to your living body (ending the spell) or to try to possess a humanoid’s body that you can see. Creatures warded by a *protection from evil and good* or *circle of protection* spell can’t be possessed.

The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, its soul is trapped in the component, and you take control of its body. You use its physical statistics and features, but retain your alignment and mental ability scores, and your GM determines which mental features you may use. You can use your action to return to the component if it is within 100 feet, returning the target creature’s soul to its body. If the target succeeds at its Charisma saving throw, you can’t attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.

The possessed creature can perceive from the component using its senses and can repeat its saving throw as an action after every hour. It can take no other actions. On a success, the target returns to its body and you return to the component if it is within 100 feet; otherwise, you die.

If the target’s body dies while you possess it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against your spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the component if it is within 100 feet; otherwise, you die.

If the spell ends or the container is destroyed, each affected soul attempts to return to its body if it is alive and within 100 feet; otherwise, it dies. Only a *wish* spell can prevent this death.

When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the possessed creature can repeat its saving throw once per day. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the possessed creature can repeat its saving throw once per year.

If the attack hits, the target automatically fails this saving throw.

A creature is under no compulsion to answer (or answer truthfully) if you are hostile to it, or it recognizes you as an enemy.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you imbue plants with limited sentience, allowing you to communicate with them like beasts. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you imbue plants with limited animation, allowing them to freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.

You summon a large, ghostly entity which envelops you, aiding your attacks and making its own, striking down your foes. The entity is incorporeal and invulnerable. Choose a damage type when you cast this spell: cold, necrotic, or radiant. All damage dealt by this spell is of that type.

For the duration of the spell, your weapons are wreathed in ethereal light, dealing 1d4 extra damage on every hit. Any creature that takes this damage can’t regain hit points until the start of your next turn. In addition, when you cast this spell and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can command the entity to make a melee spell attack against one target within 10 feet. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 damage and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have its speed reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage dealt by the entity’s attacks increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Spell Glyph
*3rd-level abjuration*
___
- **Classes:** Bard, Cleric, Wizard
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (silver powder worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered
- **Replaces:** *Glyph of Warding*
___
When you cast this spell, you mark a fixed surface with an arcane inscription, occupying a 5-foot diameter circle. When a creature enters the glyph’s space or otherwise disturbs it, the glyph triggers.

You can refine the trigger by specifying or exempting creatures or creature types, or by specifying a password a creature can speak as a reaction to prevent the glyph from triggering.

The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found. A creature has advantage on this check if it is able to perceive magical effects, such as by casting *detect magic*. If a creature uses its action to destroy the glyph, or the surface is destroyed, the spell ends without triggering.

As part of the casting, you must cast another prepared spell of 3rd level or lower, storing it in the glyph. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action and must be able to target a creature other than the caster. When the glyph triggers, it releases the stored spell, targeting the triggering creature. If the spell targets an area or summons creatures, the effect is centered on the triggering creature. A spell requiring concentration lasts for its full duration. A triggered glyph glows brightly for the stored spell’s full duration. If a creature uses its action to destroy the triggered glyph, or the surface is destroyed, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the stored spell’s maximum level increases by 1 and the material component cost increases by 50 gp for each slot level above 3rd.

Until the spell ends, the corpse will answer up to five questions using the knowledge it possessed before its death. Its responses are typically brief, cryptic, or puzzling, but it will not lie or refuse to answer.

___
You touch the component used in the spell’s casting, multiplying the projectiles in a 60-foot cone. Make a single ranged attack roll with the weapon. Each target in the cone takes 4d8 damage on a hit, or half as much damage on a miss. The damage type is the same as that of the weapon or ammunition used as a component.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

The spell’s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4+2d4), 11th level (3d4+3d4), and 17th level (4d4+4d4).

* **Stone Meld.** You and up to 7 other Large or smaller creatures you choose are able to meld with the stone. Until the end of your next round, each willing creature can touch a 5-foot area of the stone and be absorbed into it. While absorbed, a creature cannot see or hear anything, but has tremorsense within 30 feet. A creature may exit the stone voluntarily as an action, or be ejected if the stone is destroyed or the spell ends.  
* **Stone Armor.** The stone joins with you, covering your body in a rocky exterior. You gain 10 temporary hit points and have resistance to nonmagical damage as long as you have these temporary hit points.

The area is lightly obscured, and creatures inside are deafened.

As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can direct a lightning strike from the cylinder at one creature of your choice within 60 feet of the center. Make a ranged spell attack, with advantage on the attack roll if the target is within the cylinder. On a hit, the target takes 2d12 lightning damage.

After this lightning strike, each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 thunder damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success.

You create a tiny symbol above you, which radiates hope in a 30-foot radius until the spell ends. The symbol can take whatever form you choose, such as that of your deity. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the symbol up to 30 feet.

Each non-hostile, living creature in the symbol’s radius (including you) has advantage on Wisdom saving throws, adds your spellcasting ability modifier to its death saving throws (treating rolls equal to or above 20 as a natural 20), and regains the maximum number of hit points possible from any healing.

The first time a non-hostile, living creature starts its turn in the symbol’s radius, it can use a bonus action to expend one Hit Die to regain hit points as if it had taken a short rest. If the creature had fewer hit points than half its hit point maximum, it also gains an equivalent number of temporary hit points until the spell ends.

On a success, it suffers half as much damage and no other effects.

The creature then repeats the saving throw using its original intelligence score, gaining a bonus to the roll equal to the total amount its Intelligence score has been reduced. On a success, it is no longer stunned. If a creature’s Intelligence is reduced to 0, it dies.

A creature regains 1 point of lost Intelligence after finishing a long rest. The *heal*, *mass heal*, *regenerate*, and *wish* spells can instantly restore all lost Intelligence. *Greater restoration* can restore 1d6 points of lost Intelligence.

As long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use your action to intensify the storm. You can add one of the following effects to the storm, which lasts for the duration. Adding an effect does not remove prior effects, though most effects can be added only once.

* **Lightning.** Lightning strikes rain down. As a bonus action, you can designate two points below the cloud to be struck by lightning. All creatures within a 10-foot radius of either point must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d12 lightning damage on a failure or half as much on a success.  
* **Downpour.** Torrential rain falls. The storm’s entire area becomes difficult terrain, and heavily obscured to every creature except you.

Any creature who can cast this spell or is concentrating on a spell that allows thought reading (such as *detect thoughts* or *modify memory*) can use its action to receive what a thought-wisp contains, ending the spell.

If you activate a target’s rage, it must move up to its speed at the start of its turn towards the nearest creature and use its action to make one melee attack against that creature.

After it is contacted, the entity researches the subject for up to seven days. Its discoveries appear as writing in the jeweled notebook. It might learn obscure myths, forgotten legends, or even lost secrets. The more information you possess when you cast the spell, the faster and more detailed the results will be. The entity may not understand the information it finds, and so might impart unsolved riddles, confusing poems, or other puzzling communications. Once the entity has conveyed everything it can discover, the spell ends.

#### Unerring Sentry

- **Replaces:** *Faithful Hound*
___
You conjure an arcane sentry in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. It can take any form you wish, but is obviously magical in nature, and is always Small or Medium. It lasts for the duration, until you dismiss it, until you move 100 feet from it, or until you cast the spell again.

When you cast the spell, designate any number of creatures you can see as the sentry’s allies. The sentry is invisible to everyone except its allies, and if any other creature of challenge rating 1/4 or higher comes within 60 feet of it, it calls out an alarm. It can see invisible creatures, see into the Ethereal Plane, and cannot be deceived by illusions.

As an action on your turn, you may direct the sentry to attack a target you can see within 100 feet of its original location. It can move up to 30 feet, and attack a creature within 5 feet of it.

#### Wall of Dust

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a dust bunny)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Replaces:** *Wall of Sand*
___
You construct a wall of blowing dirt and grit at a point you can see within range. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 10 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight, and a creature is blinded and deafened while within the wall. When a creature enters the wall or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, each foot that the creature moves through the wall costs 6 feet of movement. On a success, each foot that the creature moves through the wall only costs 3 feet of movement.

The wall disappears when the spell ends.

#### Warding Sigil
*1st-level abjuration*
___
- **Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Replaces:** *Blade Ward*
___
You make a magical sign, creating a protective ward around yourself. The ward has 4 hit points and is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. For the duration, whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage and the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the ward’s hit points increase by 2d4 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Water Wall
*3rd-level conjuration*
___
- **Classes:** Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a vial of pure water)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Replaces:** *Wall of Water*
___
You summon a wall of swirling water at a point you can see on the ground within range. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or shaped as a ring up to 15 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. Each foot moved through the wall costs 3 feet of movement. The wall’s water disappears when the spell ends.

A creature that starts its turn in the wall or enters it on its turn must make a Strength saving throw, suffering 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failure or half as much on a success. Ranged attacks passing through the wall have disadvantage and deal half damage. Fire effects passing through are instantly extinguished. Cold effects passing through apply to any creature within 5 feet of the point they touch the wall. Lightning effects apply half their damage to any creature in contact with the wall when they pass through.

\pagebreakNum

#### Wayfinding
*5th-level divination*
___
- **Classes:** Bard, Cleric, Druid
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (two divinatory tools to indicate direction or display an image, such as a pendulum and a mirror, worth 100 gp)
- **Duration:** 24 hours
- **Replaces:** *Find the Path*
___
You name a specific location on the same plane of existence, receiving supernatural knowledge regarding the way between you and the destination. If the destination moves to another plane, the spell fails.

When you cast the spell, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one:

* **Dowsing.** The pendulum tugs in a direction with increasing urgency as you near your destination, informing you of its distance and direction.  
* **Ascertainment.** Whenever you are presented with a choice of paths along the way to the destination, the pendulum points towards the shortest and most direct route (ignoring safety).  
* **Forecast.** The mirror displays images of the next 30 miles on the path to the destination, granting a general awareness of natural hazards or obstacles, such as decaying bridges or cliffs.

#### Wellspring
*2nd-level transmutation*
___
- **Classes:** Druid, Ranger
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny silver watering can)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Replaces:** *Healing Spirit*
___ 
You pour out a stream of pure water and create a 10-foot radius magical healing pool at a point on the ground you can see within range. At any time (no action required by you) you can choose to restore 2d4 hit points to any creature in the pool, depleting the pool’s magic. The pool’s magic is restored at the start of each of your turns.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 and the radius of the pool increases by 5 feet.

#### Whirling Blades
*2nd-level conjuration*  
___
* **Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard  
* **Casting Time:** 1 action  
* **Range:** 60 feet  
* **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of metal shavings)  
* **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
___
You produce a storm of metal shards that occupy a 5-foot diameter sphere in a space you can see within range. A creature takes 4d4 slashing damage when it enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there.

As an action, you can cause the blades to point and shoot at a creature within 30 feet of the sphere. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, targets take 4d4 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a miss. Hit or miss, the spell then ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Whirlpool
*5th-level evocation*  
___
* **Classes:** Druid  
* **Casting Time:** 1 action  
* **Range:** 120 feet  
* **Components:** V, S, M (a spoon)  
* **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___
You conjure a 30-foot radius circle of churning water centered on a point on the ground or in a body of water which you can see within range. The whirlpool’s area is difficult terrain, but it is not deep enough to require swimming. Any creature that starts its turn there or enters on its turn must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, it takes 5d8 bludgeoning damage and is pulled 10 feet towards the center. If the spell targets an existing body of water, the damage increases by 1d8.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

#### Whirling Water
*4th-level conjuration*  
___
* **Classes:** Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard  
* **Casting Time:** 1 action  
* **Range:** 90 feet  
* **Components:** V, S, M (a droplet of water)  
* **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___
You create a swirling ball of water in a 10-foot radius at a point on the ground or in water you can see within range. Any creature that enters the sphere on its turn or starts its turn in it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained and trapped within the water. At the start of each of its turns, a restrained target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. A Huge or smaller creature partially within the sphere makes its saving throw with advantage, while a Gargantuan creature automatically succeeds.

As an action, you can cause the sphere to roll up to 30 feet, carrying all restrained creatures with it and dousing all nonmagical flame it passes through. If this causes a creature in the sphere to collide with a creature outside it, both creatures take 4d6 bludgeoning damage. Restrained creatures are not affected by any terrain the sphere passes over.

As a bonus action, you can hurl a restrained creature out of the sphere. It is thrown 20 feet in a direction of your choice and takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage. If it collides with another creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 bludgeoning damage.

When the spell ends, creatures restrained by it fall prone, and all fires within 20 feet are extinguished. The water disappears afterward.

*8th-level necromancy*
___
- **Classes:** Sorcerer, Wizard
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a fistful of fine sand and a drop of blood)
- **Duration:** 1 round
- **Replaces:** *Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting*
___
You shrivel and decay every living thing within a 30-foot cube you can see within range, sucking the life away until the targets crumble to dust. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 12d8 necrotic damage, has its speed halved and has disadvantage on all of its attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects.

Constructs and undead automatically succeed on this saving throw, while plants have disadvantage. Anything reduced to 0 hit points while under the spell’s effect crumbles to dust.

# Appendix 2: Design Notes
___
We don't have design notes for spells written by KibblesTasty, but broadly like everything he did with them. 

#### Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting
*Replaced With:* Withering Field

* Added half-movement and disadvantage-on-stuff riders
* Copied mechanic from Rot to have constructs and undead auto-succeed instead of full immunity
* Changed M component
* Honestly didn't change damage, I think the damage is alright
* Added disintegration-prone rider

#### Absorb Elements
*Replaced With:* Elemental Reflection

Man, this one was really hard. The original spell's excellent; mildly too strong, but not incredibly. But there's a *ton* of demand for an SRD-safe equivalent, and you need one that's distinctive enough to not be ripping off the original. I think we managed.
* Trade off bonus damage or full-round resistance
* Broadly buffed all the damage applications

#### Acid Arrow
*Replaced With:* Caustic Quarrel

Acid Arrow's just terrible, its numbers are really low. Buffed it to well above curve, to compensate for the delayed-damage aspect, and added it to the sorcerer list to make black and copper draconic sorcerers functional.

#### Aganazzar's Scorcher
*Replaced With:* Stream of Flame

A consistent underperformer; it's probably a victim of the DMG's spell-balance guidelines assuming AoEs are all alike, when line spells are in fact pretty tricky to get 3+ targets with. Buffed its base damage and gave it range on upcast.

#### Alter Self
*Replaced With:* Adaptation
Basically widening the use case and turning it into a support spell, instead of a weird sidegrade of Disguise Self.

* Changed from self to touch
* Removed concentration
* Added gliding
* Added prehensile tail
* AHL for additional options every 2 levels, and scaling natural weapons.

#### Animal Friendship & Animal Messenger
*Replaced With:* Befriend Beast

Animal Messenger, in particular, is just an extremely niche spell. Its various limitations are basically about keeping its power sensible relative to Sending, but it just turns out to be something that it _never_ makes sense to waste a spell-known on.
* Merged Animal Messenger's functions down into Animal Friendship.
* Can upcast for either more duration or more targets

\columnbreak

#### Animate Dead
*Replaced With:* Reanimation and Greater Reanimation

Realistically, we don't expect everyone to be on board - disagreement about the spell's problems is pretty wide. We wanted something a little less clunky, a little more flavorful, and safe to grant to warlocks. We split it into two so the higher-level spell can do a better job of embodying more powerful reanimation fantasies.

* Reworked to base off zombie/skeleton templates rather than hard stat blocks
  * Intentionally, the templates produce normal skeletons and zombies when used on commoners
* 3rd-level spell is fairly limited, works slowly
* 6th-level lets you raise a horde instantly, as well as animate monster corpses

#### Animate Objects
*Replaced With:* Command Objects

Overall, Animate Objects was too strong in a specific, always available case - and a pain to run, to boot.  This replacement offers more choices (versatility being the point compared to most summons) for the player and the DM, while requiring far less math and fewer rolls.
* Tiny was the obvious (and almost always the only) choice; now there are reasons to use different objects when available.
* Objects in general lack useful features and traits from the TCoE summons and are mainly about damage, though clever players who use their environment (rather than carry around those ball bearings, slingstones, or whatever) retain unique and rewarding options.

#### Antilife Shell
*Replaced With:* Nature's Protection

Antilife Shell is one of the very strangest spells in the game. It's on the *druid* list. (The reason it's on the druid list is a tortured history across multiple editions, where it's never been very good). We opted to preserve its existence on the druid list (more faithful to its older version) but completely rework its flavor so it makes sense there. Also, made it not suck.

* Flavor significantly revised to reflect it being a Druid spell
* RAW was mechanically an aura, language reflects that
* Reworked / buffed with options that make more thematic and mechanical sense (cover instead of an anti-life barrier that wasn't good because a ton of undead and constructs are melee-based, etc.) 

#### Arcane Gate
*Replaced With:* Fleeting Portals
* Increased control and flexibility - portals can be opened anywhere within 500 feet (though no further)
* Can move them, open / close them, same visibility as RAW - but can see through (and shoot through) them

\pagebreakNum

#### Armor of Agathys
*Replaced With:* Eldritch Armor

Capping it at 5th keeps it from getting out of hand on full casters, and adding some randomness is effectively the mild nerf it needs.
* Capped it at 5th level

#### Arms of Hadar
*Replaced With:* Eldritch Rift

Arms of Hadar isn't terrible, but it does underperform. The damage is alright, but its role is as a disengage tool, and it's not reliable enough at that.
* Buffed damage from 2d6 to 3d4 (better first the flavor of getting battered by tentacles)
* Added disadvantage on opp attacks even on save success
* Greatly buffed AHL scaling from 1d6 to 2d4
* Added AHL range scaling

#### Banishing Smite
*Replaced With:* Disrupting Smite

Banishing Smite's an oddball. It is almost the only smite spell that works at range, and with its banish-on-hp-threshold mechanic, it's less a control spell and more of an execute. It can be made more consistent, both with the other smites and with our own Expulsion (see Banishment).

* Changed from any range to melee only (consistent with other smite spells)
* Replaced hp-threshold banish with a half-phase that provides good control
* Changed school to evocation (consistent with other smite spells)

#### Banishment
*Replaced With:* Expulsion

Banishment's too strong. A good test is "Would this spell feel like stupid bullshit if the DM used it against players?" And Banishment absolutely fails that test. So Expulsion slows down its effects. This one went through a _lot_ of drafts, turned out to be quite a hard job. Probably a little overnerfed, but much closer to proper balance than the original was.

* Incapacitates on first round, sends to demiplane on second, sends to home plane on third.
* Fixes some of the slightly weird planar interactions

#### Barkskin
*Replaced With:* Oakenhide

Barkskin's never been good. 16 AC just isn't that high, and it's Concentration on top of that. Oakenhide leans harder on the theme - the temp hp represents the bark, which gets stripped off as you get hit. In workshopping, this got about equal parts "too weak", "too strong", and "just right", and in testing it's mostly worked well.

#### Beacon of Hope
*Replaced With:* Symbol of Resilience
* Made it a movable symbol (an actual beacon of hope)
*Replaced advantage on death saving throws with spellcasting ability modifier (roughly the same / better scaling math), allowing for more-likely "natural 20s" and 1 hit point recoveries.
* Added the ability to use a BA to spend 2 hit dice, once
* Further reinforced its ability to "turn the tide" with temporary hp if the recipient is under half health
* Added AHL to spend more hit dice

#### Beast Bond & Beast Sense
*Replaced With:* Animal Ally

Beast Bond is bad; Beast Sense is borderline-useless and inferior to Find Familiar. Merging these two makes sense. It gives Beast Bond some more utility out of combat and broader use cases. And Beast Bond itself got some damage buffs in combat, which makes it a solid alternative to Hunter's Mark for rangers with pets.

#### Blade Ward
*Replaced With:* Warding Sigil

Blade Ward, like True Strike, is almost never useful. But if you buff it enough to be useful, it gets *much* too good. So in this case, it got reworked very substantially. Switched to a bonus action and to a defined amount of damage resist, but very good against physical damage.

#### Blight
*Replaced With:* Rot

Blight's just weak, and its strong situation is _very_ situational.
* Buffed damage by 1d8
* Changed rider from "great against plants" to "disadvantage on everything for a round"

#### Blink
*Replaced With:* Ethereal Slip

* Reworked it from 1d20 every round to alternating (dis)advantage - so you're more likely to blink if you didn't, less likely to blink if you did
* Cleaned up text a bit
* Changed school to conjuration

#### Bones of the Earth
*Replaced With:* Impaling Spires

Most absolutely metal spell name and concept in the game, hamstrung by being utterly useless much of the time.
* Dropped all the difficult terrain stuff, cast another spell if you want that.
* Damage no longer gated on environment, but buffed with favorable environment
* Ability check vs. save DC corrected

#### Borrowed Knowledge
*Replaced With:* Erudition

Borrowed Knowledge is an annoying spell - it's available too early, and makes the caster too much of a Swiss-army knife. Buffing it but pushing it back to 3rd, with a hefty component cost, is a good compromise.
* 2nd to 3rd
* Expertise if you had proficiency
* Elven Accuracy Knowledge if you had expertise

\pagebreakNum

#### Branding Smite
*Replaced With:* Luminous Smite

This one's gonna get a little hate - there are people who love Branding Smite specifically and only because it works on ranged attacks. But it pretty clearly isn't supposed to.

* buffed damage slightly to d8's (more consistent with radiant)
* restricted to melee
* works against darkness as well as all invisibility sources

#### Burning Hands
*Replaced With:* Cone of Flame

Gave it range scaling on upcast. Because honestly it's a pretty decent spell, but it deserves to be more interesting for something so iconic.

#### Catnap
*Replaced With:* Power Word Nap

Catnap's got a minor issue: the DMG lists variant resting rules, and Catnap does not respect them. Power Word Nap will work for your games on Gritty Realism, Epic Heroism, or the popular 10-minute short rest house rule.

#### Cause Fear
*Replaced With* Fearsome Visage

Cause Fear's a standard across every edition, which makes it pretty weird that it's not in the SRD. A basic frighten spell is definitely something needed, so we wrote our own that's sufficiently distinctive.
* Changed school to illusion
* Buffed range from 60 to 90
* Changed components (from V,S)

#### Chaos Bolt
*Replaced With:* Prismatic Bolt

The original's fine, but it's unfortunate that the trademark sorcerer spell is still basically worse than Chromatic Orb. And it really needs to be twinnable - the sorcerer's iconic spell needs to work with their iconic ability.

* Changed how the randomness aspect works
* Eliminated multi-target aspect, to make it twinnable
* Changed the table to damage type + added effect, vs. just damage type
* Changed upcasting so it lets you select the damage type

#### Chill Touch
*Replaced With:* Ghost Touch

_So many people_ have assumed this spell does cold damage. It got some rephrasing at the same time, just to be a little shorter.

* Name
* More concise language vs wordy original

#### Circle of Death
*Replaced With:* Necrotic Sphere

Circle of Death is a weak spell, whose niche is an _utterly_ massive area of effect. We buffed its damage up to be on-curve, and changed the way the area of effect works a little bit so as to make it possible to use without blowing up your friends.

* Now has a limit to the number of targets, which makes it easier to use when there are things within a 60' radius that you don't want to murder. 
* Buffed the damage a bit.
* No longer has a costly material component (this had no reason other than to punish necromancers for doing necromancy)

#### Cloud of Daggers
*Replaced With:* Whirling Blades

Cloud of Daggers is a classic spell that _sounds_ really cool, but then a player casts it once, realizes it's extremely hard to use effectively, and never casts again. Whirling Blades preserves its base case (guaranteed-damage area denial, but a tiny area to reflect its low level). But it tacks on an action-fling, which mitigates the case where the spell didn't deliver _any_ value and adds a boost to make it substantially more likely to deliver its intended value.

#### Color Spray
*Replaced With:* Dazzle
* Ditched max-hit-points mechanic - was inevitably disappointing when Sleep exists.
* Caster's location is automatically obscured (effectively a free disengage)
* Increased AoE
* Gave it AoE scaling
* Slightly buffed effect

#### Confusion
*Replaced With:* Bewilder

Confusion just consistently underwhelms. Its most defining feature is the random movement, though, so we opted to bake that in more squarely.

* Buffed AoE from 10' to 20'
* Eliminated chance of creature ignoring the spell
* Turned movement effect into an always-on circumstance, though reduced it.
* Rewrote effects table to a d4, with effects that are easier to adjudicate.

#### Conjure Animals
*Replaced With:* Conjure Beast Pack

Conjure Animals is well-known as a broken spell. If your DM lets you choose the beasts, you can pick wolves, constrictor snakes, velociraptors, or something else that can come in groups to snap a fight in two. And of course, all those dice rolls can also slow combat to a crawl. So it gets a significant mechanical rework - attempts to preserve the idea of a swarm of creatures, while reducing the number of rolls, and incentivizing the player to focus targets to reduce the rolls further.

#### Conjure Barrage
*Replaced With:* Spreadshot

The original's garbage, its only (very small) niche is doing mild damage over a bonkers-huge area. We tested several more complicated concepts before coming back around to the original; the simplest change is usually the best.
* Attack roll replaces Dex saving throw
* Damage increased by 1d8
* Upcasting added

\pagebreakNum

#### Contagion
*Replaced With:* Inflict Disease

Contagion's got a sordid history. Its original incarnation was extremely powerful because it forced disadvantage on its own saves. Then WotC used Sage Advice to nerf it into the ground because they wouldn't admit they'd made a drafting error. Then they errata'd it, making its disease aspect useless but turning it into guaranteed poison. Weird. Inflict Disease basically restores Contagion to its original version, but with better-balanced disease effects.

#### Control Weather
*Replaced With:* Alter Weather

Control Weather's an interesting spell, lorewise, but very difficult for a party to actually use. It's almost prohibitively high level, at 8th, and leaves its *actual* effects almost entirely up to the DM.
* Reduced level from 8th to 6th
* Reduced duration and area (at 7th, it matches the original)
* Added explicit effect descriptions to weather conditions
* Gave it a monster upcast at 9th
* Adjusted change speed from random (1d4x10 minutes) to fixed (30 minutes)

#### Control Winds
*Replaced With:* Shape Winds
* Increased AoE from 100' cube to 300' cube
* ~~Gusts~~ Gale: nullifies ranged attacks entirely, movement reduction increased, buffs movement in favorable direction
* ~~Updraft~~ Thermal Column: changed fall damage from half to damage reduction (so small falls are effectively feather falled). increased jump bonus.
* ~~Downdraft~~ Turbulence: Punishes ranged attacks less hard than Gale, reduces fly speed even on success

#### Crown of Madness
*Replaced With:* Unbridled Fury

Crown of Madness is borderline useless; the enemy can trivially counterplay the spell by just not standing next to their mind-controlled friend. And if you have anything more important to do on your turn, the spell ends. Garbage.
* Spell no longer ends if you don't activate it on a turn
* Creature can move before attacking
* Got unique upcasting (enables Multiattack)

#### Dancing Lights
*Replaced With:* Ghost Lights

*Light* fills the function as a travel cantrip and a fairly bold exploration tool. Dancing Lights is subtler, and more cautious. The base spell also requires concentration which _instantly_ makes it terrible, concentration is a heavy price on a cantrip.

* Removed concentration
* Duration increased to 10 minutes
* Added color option
* Radius increased - total light radius is about half what Light provides, but careful placement allows for some tactical darkness zones.
* Removed the weird humanoid shape thing, it never made any sense and Minor Illusion does it better.

#### Danse Macabre
*Replaced With:* Corpse Puppets

In general we don't like spells that require opening up a DM resource (like a monster manual) to run; a spell should contain everything the player needs. Danse Macabre also tended to underperform, especially given how cool it is conceptually.

#### Daylight
*Replaced With:* Brilliance

Because everybody always thinks it creates sunlight (and vampires don't deserve to get hard-countered by a 3rd-level spell).
* Fixed the friggin' name
* Made it upcastable

#### Detect Evil and Good
*Replaced With:* Detect Otherworldly Influence

Minor changes here, but of course the name was bad since it had nothing to do with evil or good. But it's also situational enough that it makes a good ritual, and it got a tiny buff to checks just to bring the power up a smidge.
* Fixed name.
* Made it a ritual.
* Gave it a small buff for perception and insight checks.

#### Dispel Evil and Good
*Replaced With:* Sacred Circle

Dispel Evil and Good is very niche, with its most important function (banishment) overlapping entirely with Banishment.
* Duration increased to 10 minutes (buff)
* Large Cylindrical AoE (buff)
* Added aberrations, just like PfEaG (small obvious buff)
* Aura attack disadvantage from otherworldly creatures (buff)
* Unlimited "Break Enchantment" (big buff)
* Added Anti-summon, teleport, interplanar travel to the area (somewhat niche buff)
* Removed banishment concept (nerf)

#### Divine Favor
*Replaced With:* Sacred Strikes

After comprehensively reviewing all the weapon-buff spells and applying the same math we're pretty sure WotC used to make them, it became clear that Divine Favor's not good enough. Let's be real, it's never better than just casting Bless. This version still isn't competitive, really - Bless is too good - but if your goal is to maximize a single character's damage, this is at least better within that use case.
* Buffed duration from 1m to 10m
* Buffed to 1d6 damage

\pagebreakNum

#### Dominate Beast
*Replaced With:* Command Beast

It might not look like it, but this was one of the most contentious spells in the whole collection. The original's pretty limited at 4th level; by that point, beasts are pretty rare as enemies, so it tends not to see much use. So we reduced the level to 3rd, but attached a CR limit to keep it from breaking early encounters. A lot of discussion was devoted to making it work for rangers, but the conclusion in the end was that it *can't* be good on rangers without being too good on druids.

#### Earth Tremor
*Replaced With:* Earth Rumble

Earth Tremor's conceptually sound, but just very very weak. The damage is pitiful, and while it's meant as an "oh-shit" button for the caster, the difficult terrain hurts them more than anybody else.
* Buffed damage from 1d6 to 2d6 (save for half)
* Changed spell type from evocation to transmutation
* Changed difficult terrain rules so it's not permanent
* Gave it (very conservative) upcast radius scaling

#### Earthbind
*Replaced With:* Earth Leash

Earthbind was just miserably situational. Earth Leash is still pretty situational, but gets a little damage to improve its primary use case, and can be upcast against multiple targets. Has *any effect at all* against non-flying targets now, too.

#### Elemental Bane
*Replaced With:* Expose Weakness

Elemental Bane is the sort of spell that's pretty good in its very narrow niche, but that niche is in fact *very* narrow. Most of the time if there's a target important enough to cast elemental bane on, it's a better idea to shut them down with a control spell. Switching the spell to a weaker save makes it much more reliable; switching it to a bonus action makes it much cheaper in terms of action economy. Broadening the damage types broadens its niche.
* Shifted from action to bonus action
* Damage is capped per-round (with upcasting to increase the cap)
* Save is changed from Con to Cha
* Broadened applicable damage types

#### Elemental Weapon
*Replaced With:* Imbue Element

Elemental Weapon's very weak; its primary benefit is simulating a magic weapon, but in most games, that's just not needed. So instead it gets a small damage buff, and rider effects according to the element chosen. (Also, thunder's much stronger than the other types, so it's removed).

#### Encode Thoughts
*Replaced With:* Thought Wisp

* Enchantment to Transmutation
* Buffed duration up to 24 hours
* Specified recipients, or not! - DMs and player options
* Clarified thought-types, reduced ambiguity regarding both utility and mechanics

\columnbreak

#### Enemies Abound
*Replaced With:* False Foes

Enemies Abound is perfectly fine, but a little easy for players to cheese their way out of. ("Oh no, I'm surrounded by enemies, the only thing I'd ever do is run.") At the end of the day that's between a player and their DM, but tightening up the language can help nudge the player towards doing the right thing.

#### Enervation
*Replaced With:* Drink Life

* Increased damage by 50%; now hits above curve after 2 turns, instead of 4.
* Reduces target's movement speed (thematically fatiguing them, mechanically helping keep them in range)
* Eliminated same-target restriction and the witch bolt mechanics it inherited
* Changed from Dex to Con save for better theme and to compensate for the buffs above

#### Enthrall
*Replaced With:* Captivate

* Captivation on creatures within range over the entire duration
* Visual and auditory captivation
* Added initiative disadvantage, movement speed reduction and no reactions
* Added duration and radius increase with upcasting 
* Clarified creatures are unaware of magical influence (essentially the opposite of Friends)

#### Fabricate
*Replaced With:* Assemble

Fabricate's hard. By default, it's not tremendously useful, *unless* you take advantage of its loose definition of "raw materials" to do a bunch of things it's not meant for. As of this writing, this is maybe the spell in the whole set we're most iffy on - it's always going to be niche.

#### Faithful Hound
*Replaced With:* Unerring Sentry

Rather than try to make it a useful combat spell (which there are plenty of options for, including Arcane Hand at a similar level), we tried to make it better at its situational use case. So basically the only changes are:
* You can designate allies (which fixes the weird password thing)
* It can move within a 100' radius of the original cast location, and requires your action to attack if you're awake.

#### Feeblemind
*Replaced With:* Shatter Mind

Absolutely needed a rename for sensitivity reasons, and might as well clean the mechanics up while we're at it.
* Renamed
* Range reduction (minor, enables counterspell)
* Save time reduced (to make it possible, albeit painful, to wait for natural recovery)
* Clarified what it means to have 1 Int (Ooze-grade intelligence)

\pagebreakNum

#### Feign Death
*Replaced With:* False Death

The original's role is _so_ specific that it's basically just a plot spell. Buffed it into a bit of a higher-level False Life with added utility for the spell's original functions.

* 10 temp hp
* Reaction allows in-combat use
* Clarified breathing
* Removed incapacitation, spell just ends if target takes an action etc.
* This allows them to continue to concentrate on a spell (!)
* Removed blindness
* Can act normally, ending the spell - enabling in-combat psychological surprises

#### Find the Path
*Replaced With:* Wayfinding

Find the Path is a plot spell, but a particularly tedious one. We made it a little more applicable (can now find ships, vehicles, etc.), and gave its detailed functions a level of interactivity. Also removed the requirement to have an item from the location, which in practice made it only usable with the DM's advance planning for it.

#### Find Traps
*Replaced With:* Detect Hazards

Find traps is *garbage*, just utterly useless. It doesn't tell you where the traps are, it's instantaneous, and it doesn't even work on half of what you'd want it to.
* duration from Instantaneous to Concentration (10m)
* gives exact location within 15 feet
* grants advantage on checks to investigate
* blocked by the usual stuff
* buffed to apply to natural hazards as well

#### Finger of Death
*Replaced With:* Death Ray

* Increased damage (from 61.5 to 74, vs. disintegrate's 85.5 upcast). Still less than disintegrate, but does half on a miss.
* Changed to an attack roll (but still half damage on miss).
* Fixed weirdness about zombification so being a PC doesn't save you
* Gave it great upcasting

#### Fire Storm
*Replaced With:* Rain of Fire

Fire Storm's a little tricky; it's mildly iconic, especially for druids, but also mediocre. Its novel AoE is fairly complicated in play but usually boils down to "pick 6 targets or so within a giant AoE". Its damage is unfortunately pretty terrible. But if you just fix the damage and streamline the AoE, you get something that's quite bland, and not a very distinctive or interesting spell. So we opted instead to turn it into a high-level upgrade on Call Lightning, to keep it iconically druidic.

\columnbreak

#### Fireball
*Replaced With:* Fireblast

We tried about a dozen different versions of fireball - but at the end of the day, it's got a simple problem: it does too much damage. So the fix is accordingly simple. (It's still above curve for 3rd level, but that's fine; it doesn't have any added effects, and fire spells tend to be high damage.)
* Standardized range to 120ft
* Reduced damage from 8d6 to 7d6

#### Flame Arrows
*Replaced With:* Fiery Quiver

Flame Arrows is very, very weak; Hex will outperform it almost every time. Fiery Quiver doubles the rate the damage comes out (though it cuts the duration down to compensate).

#### Flame Blade
*Replaced With:* Fiery Blade

Flame Blade is famously garbage - it just doesn't work for any build. But Shadow-Blade-alikes are a fairly good template to use.
* More light
* Grants proficiency
* Thrown & reappear, akin to Shadow Blade
* Damage over time now with control properties

#### Flame Strike
*Replaced With:* Holy Fire

Flame Strike's not terrible, but it's consistently underwhelming. This just buffs the damage until it's acceptable, and adds a rider about cover inspired by Sacred Flame.

#### Flesh to Stone
*Replaced With:* Petrify

The base Flesh to Stone is underwhelming. A 6th-level slot to inflict restrained is a very high price; with 3 rounds until petrification, it almost never triggers. We debated lots of different versions, and landed on the most conservative, just buffing it until it's worth using.

* Failing by 5 or more is instant petrify (consistent mechanics with medusas)
* Restrained after 1 failure, petrified after another
* Concentration changed to 3 rounds as it's decided by then

#### Force Cage
*Replaced With:* Confinement

Force Cage has the same problem as Wall of Force; it's absolute and doesn't have any options for counterplay. So we also made it breakable.

\pagebreakNum

#### Freezing Sphere
*Replaced With:* Mass Freeze & Glacial Orbs

* ~~Reworked into a DoT+mild control spell. Still hits a giant AoE, though less giant (still giant, though).~~
* ~~Ditched the load-it-into-a-sling business, that was weird.~~
 
~~Freezing Sphere and Circle of Death were too mechanically similar, so we reworked Blizzard heavily to give them distinct identities.~~
There was a fair objection that Blizzard was a total reimagining. So we went back to the drawing board and...reimagined it harder? Mass Freeze is actually a spell written in another context, for a different purpose, but it does a good job of being a high-level cold spell with AoE control effects. Tiny Comets is new, intended to capture the fantasy behind Freezing Sphere's "trap it in a pellet" idea.

#### Friends
*Replaced With:* Befriend

* Duration upped to 10m
* No longer applies to Intimidation checks
* Material component changed to 1cp which is consumed, because that's funnier
* Fixed the self-target weirdness, which enabled some really goofy abuse when applied strictly RAW.

#### Frost Fingers
*Replaced With:* Arctic Breath

Frost Fingers never had a reason to exist, and is basically strictly worse than Burning Hands. KibblesTasty's Arctic Breath fits the bill nicely, distinguishing itself with a different AoE and applying a nice rider effect.

#### Frostbite
*Replaced With:* Black Ice

Frostbite's perfectly fine, actually, but its effect made more sense for Sapping Sting/Draining Bolt.

#### Geas
*Replaced With:* Injunction

* Sight not required
* Damage changed to a reduction to max HP
* Remove curse must match spell's level
* Greater Restoration removes reduction but does not end the spell 
* Hp reduction scales with slot
* Death does not end the spell

#### Glyph of Warding
*Replaced With:* Spell Glyph

* Reduced cast time to 10m
* Reworked mechanics to avoid many types of cheese
* Eliminated Explosive Runes option entirely
* Scaled material component cost

#### Goodberry
*Replaced With:* Magic Fruit

No DM who's ever attempted a survival game is okay with Goodberry. For a tiny cost, it trivializes a huge range of challenges. Magic Fruit just fixes that.

\columnbreak

#### Grasping Vine
*Replaced With:* Lashing Vine

Grasping vine is *awful*. It's a 4th-level spell, with concentration, that arguably underperforms many 1st-levels.

* 4th to 2nd level, for all that is holy, this was worse than Entangle RAW
* Removed concentration, 1 minute duration remains (actually allowing the combo of this + Spike Growth)
* Can only grab Large or smaller creatures
* Vine has AC and HP for counterplay, now that concentration is gone
* Added upcasting

#### Guidance
*Replaced With:* Benediction

* Increased range
* Increased casting time to reduce spammability
* Called out that other creatures are aware of it (prevent its use on social checks)
* Added recommendation to prevent stacking with similar effects

#### Harm
*Replaced With:* Wound
* Immunity to disease no longer makes you immune to the spell (watch out, paladins, monks, etc.)
* Hit point maximum reduced on a success, too
* Greater Restoration is needed to restore a reduction to hit point maximum, not lay on hands

#### Heat Metal
*Replaced With:* Enkindle

This one's probably had the most polarizing feedback (aside from Deflect). Heat Metal's obviously overpowered, particularly with the cook-and-book strategy. Disarming opponents is also frequently crippling.
* Affects any object, not just metal ones.
* No longer affects armor.
* Damage halved.
* No longer costs bonus action to use.
* Creatures can make a Con save to ignore the disadvantage.

\pagebreakNum

#### Healing Spirit
*Replaced With:* Wellspring

Healing Spirit was wildly overpowered in its initial implementation, because of the "conga line" exploit — any number of creatures could move through the spirit's space within the same turn. This meant a spell designed to heal one creature for 1d6 damage per turn could instead get applied to your entire party, and heal everyone up to full health without fail. WotC opted to nerf it _not_ by fixing the conga line, but instead capping the number of uses. This turns the spell into a poor-but-occasionally-useful combat heal, and makes it nearly pointless outside combat (Prayer of Healing, a mediocre spell at the same level, heals 4x as much). Our rework for Wellspring is designed to fix the conga line, restore the spell's utility as an out-of-combat heal, and produce a situationally-useful combat heal.
* Reflavored & slightly reworked to a stationary AoE
* Changed from a bonus action to an action
* Buffed healing from 1d6 to 2d4
* Strictly limited its use to 1/round
* Scaling: 1d4 per slot level and the pool size increases; pool size is irrelevant for out-of-combat healing but makes in-combat healing with it significantly more flexible

#### Ice Knife
*Replaced With:* Frost Shuriken

Ice Knife requires two rolls for full effect - attack roll and Dex save. In practice it winds up just being super low damage. Frost Shuriken fixes that by giving the primary target full damage.
* Primary target takes full damage after the attack roll.
* Piercing damage reduced, cold damage increased.

#### Ice Storm
*Replaced With:* Hailstorm

Mostly this got a damage buff so it doesn't underwhelm quite so hard, but also got a relatively-unique AoE scaling for upcast, to help distinguish it from fireball.

* Buffed Damage
* Added AHL AoE scaling

#### Illusory Script
*Replaced With:* Secret Missive

* Gave it duration scaling based on component cost (so you can still ritual cast and get duration scaling)
* Fixed a weird debatable loophole where you cast it backwards, designating every creature except your target, which means the entire world sees the fake message, which breaks the truesight interaction.
* Changed its mechanic to a password, which opens up more fun gameplay scenarios

#### Immolation
*Replaced With:* Incinerate

Immolation's in the category of spells that are extremely slot-efficient (80d6 damage!) but almost never useful in practice. This does change its role a bit, but concentration-single-target-damage-over-time is just not a great role.

* Buffed the damage
* Moved damage to start-of-turn (more logical, easier tracking)
* Spread it to another creature with a bonus action
* Made the turn-to-ash legitimately scary

#### Imprisonment
*Replaced With:* Seal Away

* Dropped level from 9th to 8th
* Reduced component cost
* Condensed text

#### Infernal Calling
*Replaced With:* Devil Binding

The original's a giant wall of text, and the inconsistency of summoning uncontrollable fiends made it virtually unusable.

* Changed CR to 4-8 window, to make clear that this summons big-deal fiends.
* Eliminated inconsistent obedience. Instead, it obeys commands for 1 minute and then does what it likes (which probably involves wheeling and dealing).
* If you can't hold concentration for the whole hour, you've just unleashed a nasty on the world.
* Changed component and reduced cost

#### Infestation
*Replaced With:* Stinging Insects

The original isn't terrible, just a little underwhelming. Strong save, weak damage, and random movement is fiddly to adjudicate and hard to use. 
* Buffed damage from 1d6 poison to 2d4 poison/piercing
* Made movement non-random

#### Legend Lore
*Replaced With:* Unearth Legend

The original spell here was very limited, and _very_ annoying for a DM. Unless you know in advance your players are planning to cast LL, you'll just sound dopey trying to improvise a poem or riddle on the spot.

* No longer requires target to be "of legendary importance"
* Allows ritual casting
* Returns information slowly over a week, which probably gives the DM enough time to push the big reveal to next week's session and write a poem for it

#### Life Transference
*Replaced With:* Siphon Life

The original's quite niche, and consequently very rarely taken. It's very difficult to use unless your wizard has a reliable way to recover the health, and logically, it's not clear why the caster's health is worth twice as much for somebody else.
* Removed 2x healing for 1x damage (never made sense)
* Target other creatures except constructs or undead

#### Lightning Arrow
*Replaced With:* Lightning Burst

* Made it work in melee
* Made it select targets rather than an AoE
* Buffed damage substantially for primary target, slightly for secondary targets

\pagebreakNum

#### Lightning Bolt
*Replaced With:* Lightning Beam

Honestly, Lightning Bolt's *fine*, it doesn't really need a replacement. But it's always hard to hit more than two targets with a line spell, and in past editions, the spell's ricochet ability was *fun*. So we brought it back! Balancewise, this just makes it easy to hit a third target.

* Enabled a caster-controlled ricochet.

#### Lightning Lure
*Replaced With:* Lightning Leash

Kept the conceptual idea of a tether made of lightning, but the base spell's mechanics were just a total failure - didn't work at all. Its secondary effect is fairly potent for a cantrip, but costs a reaction to compensate.

#### Locate Animals or Plants
*Replaced With:* Find in Nature

The original's almost never worth taking as a second-level spell. The fact that it's a ritual saves it, a bit, but it's still extremely specific. Bumping it down to first is more appropriate for its power level, and giving it an ability to upcast keeps it interesting for higher-difficulty terrain and higher-level adventures.

#### Maelstrom
*Replaced With:* Whirlpool

* Clarified that the disc cannot force a creature to swim (which would double the movement penalty)
* Added a 1-level bonus if cast on water instead of on land
* Added a tame AHL
* Changed M component

#### Magic Circle
*Replaced With:* Circle of Protection

Magic Circle's *very important* for certain types of fantasy - conjuring up demons to do your bidding basically requires it. But the cast time makes the spell virtually impossible for PCs to use. So we turned it into a 1-action spell, and gave it a pseudo-ritual option for the slow-paced summoning.

* Added aberrations as a selectable creature type
* Increased cylinder height
* Variable casting time provides options
* Wider applicability
* Gave it duration scaling at high levels

#### Magic Jar
*Replaced With:* Soul Transfer

* Increased spell level from 6th to 7th
* Possessed creature can attempt to regain control of its body (reduced at higher levels)
* Enormous incentive for the caster to keep and protect the container
* Death Ward explicitly doesn't work
* Buff - physical (class) features can be used

\columnbreak

#### Magic Mouth
*Replaced With:* Conjure Herald

Magic Mouth (and Skywrite) are both virtually useless; one's a classic NPC-only spell, the other's a once-per-campaign-grade ritual. Skywrite's also a "big" effect, albeit one that isn't very useful; conceptually it probably doesn't belong at 2nd level. So it makes sense to mash them together, and restate the spell's mechanics so it makes sense as a 2nd-level spell.

#### Mind Spike
*Replaced With:* Psychic Skewer

Mind Spike's got an extremely weak rider, damage that's a full level below par, and costs concentration. You can't make it a good nuke, or else Divination wizards (already debatably the strongest wizards) become absolute monsters.
* Reduced duration
* Buffed the rider to work like Mind Sliver
* Adjusted old rider so it no longer requires concentration to keep up

#### Maximilian's Earthen Grasp
*Replaced With:* Earthen Hand

Opinions on this one are wildly bimodal: either completely ignored or totally beloved. So we didn't change the math or capability, but just fixed two persistent mechanical issues. One was that RAW it could grapple a Tarrasque; the other was the hand's tendency to get outpaced as the fight moves away from it. Changed the Strength check to a save for consistency's sake (which we're aware will upset some folks).

#### Meld Into Stone
*Replaced With:* Stone Pact

Meld Into Stone is a candidate for the absolute least useful spell in the game. If you've got a wizard in the party, it's ~entirely invalidated by Rope Trick and Tiny Hut. So we opted to preserve its original function as one bullet out of three, and add two more functions that are a thematic fit.

* Removed ritual casting
* Reduced duration to 1 hour
* Phrased original function more cleanly, and extended it to other creatures (enables hiding, safe short rest, ambushing)
* Added stoneskin-lite function
* Added "stone feet" function

#### Mislead
*Replaced With:* Misdirection

More focused on its stated goal of being tricksy. Less useful as a generic invisibility or scouting tool, because invisibility, find familiar, and clairvoyance compete with it there.
* Shortened duration from 1h to 10m
* Enabled reaction cast
* Attacks and Spells don't break invisibility automatically, and do appear to come from the double, but trigger disbelieve attempts

\pagebreakNum

#### Moonbeam
*Replaced With:* Lunar Beam

* Upped damage against shapeshifters
* Added disadvantage for silver-weak things (shapeshifters and fiends)
* Tiny tweak to effect-timing to improve clarity
* Adjusted shapechange restrictions for simplicity

#### Move Earth
*Replaced With:* Earth Forming

* Duration down to 1 hour (but speed doubled, so same effects)
* Changed range to Self (30 feet), vastly increasing potential area of effect.
* Enabled unique ritual casting - component consumed for ritual but not for slot-cast
* Dropped level to 5th

#### Negative Energy Flood
*Replaced with:* Necromantic Infusion and Necromantic Storm

The base spell does three things, and does them all badly. We split off the "buff an undead" function, and rewrote the rest as what a spell named "Negative Energy Flood" ought to be, an AoE nuke that makes zombies.

#### Pass Without Trace
*Replaced With:* Aura of Concealment

~~PWT is *notoriously* strong. It nullifies stealth challenges in many circumstances, and enables characters with an already-good stealth to get up into the 30+ soaring heights with regularity. The spell's so strong it influences the way DMs run stealth checks across the entire game. So YMMV depending on how your DM compensates for PWT's enormous power, but switching it to an aura of reliable talent preserves its core while bringing it down to earth.~~

We took a second crack at this one - people complained that the reliable talent aura didn't do enough for heavy-armored oafs. After a truly disgusting amount of math (simulated group stealth checks for a variety of parties in a variety of situations), it turns out the version that performs best (gets the success chance to the most appropriate percentages) is just nerfing +10 to +5.

* Creatures required to stay within range
* ~~Changed flat +10 bonus to an aura of reliable talent (Stealth)~~
* V2: Changed reliable talent aura to flat +5 bonus

#### Phantasmal Force
*Replaced With:* Hallucination and Phantasm

Phantasmal Force suffers from identity issues. It appears to be a single-target version of Major Image. But it can also deal damage, which requires slapping a save on it, which results in a lot more player confusion about what it can do. So we split it cleanly in two: Phantasm is _just_ single-target Major Image, with the same mechanics. And Hallucination takes over the role PF awkwardly sat in - defined conditions or decent damage, gated on a save.

\columnbreak

#### Phantasmal Killer
*Replaced With:* Phantasmal Horror

Fixed the weird save timing on this one. In the original, the enemy needed to fail two saves before they took any damage.

#### Planar Ally
*Replaced With:* Call for Aid

Honestly a fairly tame revision - it's so DM-dependent that there's not a whole lot you can do. Better guidelines, though, to make it more practical.

* Cut length down by a lot
* Reduced prices by half, and added guidance to let players have a freebie the first time and increase prices on repeat casting
* Eliminated XP penalty

#### Poison Spray
*Replaced With:* Poison Fang

Poison Spray's actually really tough to get right, because it's more situational than other cantrips. We opted to fix the range, and give it a pretty good rider effect; now it's the highest-damage cantrip, with a decent rider, and short range. But counteracted by a commonly-resisted damage type on the strongest save. 
* Upped range from 10' to 30'
* Added rider effect, poisoned until start of tur

#### Polymorph
*Replaced With:* Animal Transformation

Polymorph was just pretty obviously too strong. Polymorphing allies into Giant Apes was extremely disruptive, and if the enemy couldn't break your concentration, just produced a giant wall of meat to chop through.
* Changed save from Wis to Cha (buff)
* Allow a save every turn to recover from baleful polymorph (nerf)
* Capped CR at spell level or character level, whichever's lower (big nerf)

#### Primordial Ward
*Replaced With:* Elemental Shield

Primordial Ward's a cool idea, but resistance to all the elements is a giant power budget that is almost always useless. 
* Focused on a single element instead of all of them (because all is a cool idea, but is a lot of theoretical power budget but never that useful in practice)
* Change the shield as a bonus action
* Grants resistance to nearby allies

\pagebreakNum

#### Prismatic Spray
*Replaced With:* Scintillant Blast

Prismatic Spray is unfortunately pretty garbage. It's a random effect, on which *every* result is underpowered for 7th level. The damage results are below curve, and the control results literally replicate lower-level spells. The only thing that justifies 7th is the 1/8 chance to get two effects, and even that's not really that impressive. Its rainbow theming also gets weird results that don't match up to the rest of the system.
* Put damage on every effect
* Buffed damage across the board
* Added additional effects on every effect

#### Psychic Scream
*Replaced With:* Synaptic Shockwave

One of our major principles is that no spell, when used *against* the PCs, should result in immediate cries of "bullshit!". Psychic Scream is unfiltered bullshit: a concentration-less long-duration multi-target disable, which is potentially permanent against some characters. 
* damage converted to d8s for better consistency with other psychic effects
* depletes intelligence and adds the result to the save. results in long-term mind damage but a save that's far, far more likely to succeed (though an unlucky result will kill you, which is, paradoxically, much easier to fix).

#### Pyrotechnics
*Replaced With:* Burst of Flame

Pyrotechnics is a weird one - it's a 2nd-level spell that more-or-less replicates three first-level spells, and is massively constrained by the need to cast it on an existing fire. We preserved its multi-use nature, but freed it from the fire dependence; instead, it's a little underwhelming power-wise but very good if you have a fire to work with.

#### Raulothim's Psychic Lance
*Replaced With:* Synaptic Spear

Raulothim's is a spell that looks alright at a glance, but is well above curve in practice. Its damage isn't huge, but putting the incapacitated condition on an Int save is brutal control; many enemies have low enough Int that they literally can't make the save, even at pretty high levels.

#### Ray of Enfeeblement
*Replaced With:* Curse of Weakness

This one went through a bunch of drafts. The original's very situational and quite weird; buffing it at all almost immediately made it too good in its niche, though. We opted for reworking it into an AoE and basically making it silence-but-versus-martials. 

#### Ray of Sickness
*Replaced With:* Minor Drain & Touch of Filth

Ray of Sickness is one of those spells that sucks because it's a hybrid spell. It's bad at damage and bad at control; it's almost always a better choice to pick which is more important and cast a better spell for that purpose. So we split it in two, creating a 1st-level necromantic damage spell (critical for necromancy wizards) and a 2nd-level high-risk, high-reward poison spell.

\columnbreak

#### Regenerate
*Replaced With:* Rejuvenation

Regenerate, as written, is a niche out-of-combat heal and a very high level solution to the very specific problem of missing limbs. We opted to make it functional as an in-combat heal, but with a counter to keep it from being overpowered.

* Eliminated boost of initial healing
* Increased healing over time by 10x
* Reduced duration
* Reduced cast time to 1 action
* Spell ended by fire or acid

#### Sapping Sting
*Replaced With:* Draining Bolt

Disadvantage is more thematic for the spell than prone was.

#### Sequester
*Replaced With:* Safekeeping

Still a plot spell, but a more flexible and usable one now, that supports more stories.

* Decreased cost by 80%
* Increased targets from 1 to 8
* Added more flexible options

#### Shield
*Replaced With:* Deflect

Shield's fine for its primary use case (keeping a squishy caster from getting blendered), but is incredibly disruptive when it gets combined with heavy armor or other high-AC builds. We tested a _lot_ of options, and landed on the simplest one. Also, upcasting is fun.
* Capped AC boost at 21 AC.
* Granted (bad) upscaling.

#### Sickening Radiance
*Replaced With:* Irradiate
* Removed / reworked exhaustion
* Radiant damage reworked to max hp reduction
* Added upcasting to provide permanent options
* Small change: things glow more and more as they get worse and worse...

We wanted to decouple SR from exhaustion, since variant exhaustion rules are becoming more common these days. The cumulative penalties, while an annoying floating modifier, also produce a smoother curve, where it's better value if the enemy just fails one save - this mildly reduces the emphasis on the "lock 'em in a box" strategy that's popular here.

#### Silvery Barbs
*Replaced With:* Fortune & Misfortune

Silvery Barbs was entirely, vastly overpowered, and probably the most-banned spell in the game as a result.
* Split into two distinct functions, *both* of which were bumped up a level.

\pagebreakNum

#### Speak with Animals / Speak with Plants
*Replaced With:* Speak with Nature

Both these spells were deeply situational. Speak with Animals got some much-needed language tightening, and improvement for the awakened-animals use case. Speak with Plants was so situational it was virtually never picked; if it wasn't worth a spell-known, it needed to be merged into something else.


#### Speak with Dead
*Replaced With:* Spirit Remnant

Look, disguising yourself to cast this spell once is fun and interesting. But when you realize you're gonna wind up doing that *almost every time*, it's really annoying. Generally just made some key QoL improvements here.

* No longer has the "recognizes and hates you so you have to disguise yourself" problem
* Caster no longer has to ask all the questions
* Corpse is generally mildly more helpful than before

#### Skywrite
*Replaced With:* Conjure Herald and Sky Omen

Skywrite's pedestrian mechanical purpose - a non-private, limited-range *sending* - didn't deserve to be something huge and flashy like reshaping clouds. That got combined with Magic Mouth to form Conjure Herald. But it's cool to have huge, flashy things up in the sky - Sky Omen's an attempt to give that idea mechanical oomph commensurate with how cool it is.

#### Spirit Shroud
*Replaced With:* Spectral Champion

Spirit Shroud never needed to exist; it was basically a mild rework to Spirit Guardians to make it suitable for paladins (but it failed, so the spell sucked). We opted for a bigger redesign to better fill its role as an offensive equivalent to SG's defensive aura.
* Small bonus damage on every hit
* Use a BA to have a spirit attack and slow one target.

#### Snare
*Replaced With:* Magic Net

Snare's a weird case of WotC inventing a spell to represent a mundane thing, and in so doing, both making a crappy spell and invalidating the mundane equivalent. Decently hefty mechanical rework here. Added some fall damage, eliminated multiple paths to failure, made the effects more consistent. 

#### Storm of Vengeance
*Replaced With:* Tempest

Storm of Vengeance is *awful*. It's got a giant area, but its effects are pitiful except for round 3 damage and rounds 5-10 control. With no control effects until round 5, it's effectively a damage spell, but about 1/3 as strong as it needs to be to justify itself. It's basically a plot spell for destroying villages, and that's it. So we reworked it; effects fully persist, they're a choosable menu rather than a defined progression, and all the numbers have gone up. Now it's a great massive-area weak-control spell, or a solid damage spell that needs a turn of ramp-up before it gets scary (and even so, it maxes out at a little less than half a meteor swarm per round).

\columnbreak

#### Storm Sphere
*Replaced With:* Stormcloud

Storm Sphere's a spell that's *fine*, but it's a hybrid spell (in this case, AoE & ongoing-single-target). Most hybrid spells suffer because they're a little crap at both individual functions, so you generally decide what you want to do more and pick a more-focused spell for that. This primarily got a damage buff, but then also got some (beautifully thematic if I say so myself) mechanical changes to help distinguish itself from its main competitor, Sickening Radiance.
* Added ability to move the sphere
* Took away the initial damage; replaced it with lightning damage for the bolt's target and thunder damage for folks in the sphere.
* Added deafened condition because it really should have it.

#### Summon Beast
*Replaced With:* Summon Animal Spirit

Almost all the Tasha's summons are well-liked but also considered *very* strong. Not game-breaking good, but toeing the line at times. So this one gets some mild toning down.
* Upped AC by 1 and reduced base HP
* Adjusted move speeds for Sea and Sky
* Replaced Pack Tactics with Blood in the Water (for Sea)
* Adjusted damage downward
* Overall, mild nerfs to damage, slight nerfs to durability

#### Summon Construct
*Replaced With:* Summon Golem

The TCoE summons are well-liked, but of course, not well-accessible to homebrewers since they're not in the SRD. As long as we needed a cleanly-licensed spell here, we figured we'd rework the types to match published statblocks better.

* swapped types from clay/stone/metal to flesh/stone/iron
* removed incapacitated immunity
* rebuilt actions & stats

#### Summon Lesser Demons
*Replaced With:* Conjure Minor Fiends

Another case where you had to pull up the Monstrous Manual to cast the spell. Also, summoning demons that want to murder your friends is a jerk move.

* Defaults to two, CR 1 demons using a provided stat block. DM can rifle through the MM if they want.
* Interesting features: resistances, magic resist, random affliction
* Summoned creatures act like Conjure Elemental; friendly until they become a big ol' problem
* component changed to costly and mildly evil material, instead of very evil
* Upcasting simplified

#### Summon Undead
*Replaced With:* Summon Grave Spirit

All the Tasha's summons are quite strong, and Summon Undead is often regarded as the strongest of the bunch. It basically gets nerfs across the board, with a new ability added to the skeletons to make them more interesting than just pure archer-bots.

\pagebreakNum

#### Symbol
*Replaced With:* Glyph of Power

* Increased cast time to 10m
* Halved cost to 500g
* Removed cast-on-objects function
* Reworked effects entirely

The most important thing here was rebalancing the effects substantially, including mostly making them much longer duration; the original, unless used as part of a trap, mostly meant "the party sits on their hands for 10 minutes".

#### Sword Burst
*Replaced With:* Blade Burst

Very small change here - there's no good reason for the spell to do force damage. It's literally swords.

#### Telekinesis
*Replaced With:* Psychokinesis

* Replaced strength check with saving throw (nerf, but necessary to fix its legendary resistance loophole)
* More concise language
* More control (buffs) - can target willing creatures, self, optionally restrain unwilling creatures

#### Telepathy
*Replaced With:* Mind Link

* Enormous revision as telepathy is garbage as an 8th level spell (especially vs telepathic bond at 5th)
* Major change - can affect unwilling targets
* Combines with lower level divination and illusion spells
* Changed school to Enchantment

#### Temple of the Gods
*Replaced With:* Divine Temple

Level reduced to 6th, matching Druid Grove & allowing for 11th level "retirement"
* More control over the interior
* Added aberrations as a selectable creature type
* Added upcasting (time = size, up to 4 hours for 240' cube at 9th)
* Size reduced (same size as RAW when upcast at 7th)
* Disintegrate affects the wood and stone walls normally (instead of destroying the entire temple)

#### Thunderclap
*Replaced With:* Thunder Burst

Fairly weak damage for what it was, but mostly this one's a language cleanup and making it more consistent with other spells. 

* Language update and range now self, 5 foot radius like sword burst (corrects silly questions, there's a reason TCoE updated SCAG)
* Damage increase
* Niche rider: deafened until the end of its next turn

\columnbreak

#### Thunder Step
*Replaced With:* Sonic Rift

This one only needs some small tune-ups. It would be nice to make it good on non-warlocks, but that's pretty hard.
* Adjusted and slightly buffed damage to be more appropriate for thunder (d8s)
* Allowed it to explode either at start or end point (common point of confusion)
* Added somatic component

#### Tidal Wave
*Replaced With:* Riptide

We literally wrote this one totally independently, then thought "Huh, this spell must exist already," and found Tidal Wave to compare it to. It's a good niche — decent damage, decent AoE, decent control effect. Its main buff over Tidal Wave is a more usable AoE and adding a pull effect on top of the prone.
* Reduced range (120' was overkill)
* Added a 15' pull effect
* Exempted Gargantuan from prone+pull
* No longer works against flying enemies
* 50% increase to AoE (9 squares vs. 6)

#### Tiny Hut
*Replaced With:* Arcane Shelter

Broadly, Tiny Hut works fine for guaranteeing a safe rest, but is too tempting for parties to try and set up cheesy fights where it gets used as invincible cover. So the changes attempt to preserve its role while making it much harder to use in combat.

* Fails if there's not enough space (so you can't block a passageway)
* Changed from evocation to abjuration
* 10 minute cast time instead of 1m (reduces cheese)
* Projectiles can't pass through (no archers sitting inside)
* Moving through costs 25' (no darting out, attacking, darting back in)
* Made it fully translucent instead of one-way visible (so you're sacrificing good information about what's happening outside)
* Doesn't forbid Large creatures (large PC rules will happen at some point)

#### Toll the Dead
*Replaced With:* Grave Calling

Toll the Dead's _virtually_ always at full power for d12 damage, which is a little too strong.
* d12 damage when target's below half hp, instead of full hp.

#### Transmute Rock
*Replaced With:* Morph Earth

* Fixed odd/nonstandard falling damage (probable nerf, possible buff, depends)
* Changed components, concise language, etc. - this is basically SRD-ifying

#### True Strike
*Replaced With:* Fated Strike

True Strike's always going to be a lightning rod; everyone in the world has tried to fix it, generally with terrible results. We debated a hundred different cantrip versions. They were almost all too complicated, almost all too strong or too weak, and frequently had abuse cases available. So we opted to buff it and turn it into a leveled spell. When you _really_ need an attack to hit, it's a viable option.

#### Tsunami
*Replaced With:* Great Wave

Tsunami was basically "narrative destruction" - now this is both usable in combat and more flexible overall.
* Any direction along the ground instead "away from you"
* Variable cast time and size

#### Vampiric Touch
*Replaced With:* Life Drain

This is one of the biggest changes, basically a total rewrite. Vampiric Touch is an iconic spell, but 5E's version is frankly terrible; it's only usable if you're out of spell slots and slap-fighting a weak enemy. Life Drain's a pretty brutal health drain *as long as* there are enough targets available. Get your Palpatine on.

#### Vitriolic Sphere
*Replaced With:* Corrosive Burst

This one only made the cut because an SRD-friendly version was required; the base spell's honestly fine, the damage is exactly where it should be. But reworking it to a proper damage-over-time effect makes it more characteristically acidic, and increases the incentive to use it as an opener. Also changed from evocation to conjuration, because it makes more sense.

#### Wall of Force
*Replaced With:* Arcane Wall

Wall of Force is too good. It'd debatably be too good at 8th- or 9th-level; the issue is there's just no ability to counterplay it, at all. So we made it breakable.

#### Wall of Sand
*Replaced With:* Wall of Dust

Wall of Sand was excruciatingly situational; blowing a 3rd-level slot to slow your enemies by 1 round is a bad trade. It worked if you cast it lengthwise down a hallway, but only then. So we added a Str save for double the effect.

#### Wall of Water
*Replaced With:* Water Wall

* Eliminate the freezing business. It's neat but fundamentally lacking the pieces to make it mechanically adjudicable, and it'd require basically including the text of Wall of Ice to fix that.
* Make it better than difficult terrain
* Double down on the fire protection
* In fact, double down on the element modification generally, as a way to give it its own niche

#### Watery Sphere
*Replaced With:* Whirling Water

* Increased radius from 5' to 10'
* Added collision damage for a full sphere
* Added BA throw-out-of-sphere
* Eliminated levitation, it was weird and mostly created a niche mass-levitate use case

#### Weird
*Replaced With:* Phantasmal Nightmares

Weird's the go-to example of a crap high-level spell. The original is just multi-target Phantasmal Killer (which has its own problems). Buffed the damage and changed the timing so it needs two failed saves to hit the damage curve (instead of 4), and added a confusion-style table of additional terrible effects.

#### Whirlwind
*Replaced With:* Twister

This one honestly didn't need all that much, mostly fixing the sloppy drafting that plagues the EE spells.

* massively buffed area and height (which winds up adding extra fall damage)
* derandomized throw distance
* changed quite odd V,M component to standard V,S

#### Wrath of Nature
*Replaced With:* Nature's Fury

This one needs pretty dramatic mechanical changes; the original mostly doesn't have any action cost attached, but takes effect automatically based on what terrain you have available. Consequently, it had wildly varying power based on your terrain; cast it in a savannah and basically nothing happens, but cast it in a forest and you've got half a fireball going off in a 60-foot radius every turn. So we eliminated the interaction with existing terrain and made every option cost a bonus action to activate (except for grass, that's automatic now).

#### Zone of Truth
*Replaced With:* Aura of Truth

This one gets a change to line it up with how most DMs *actually* run the spell. Added bonus, it's got incentives now to end an interrogation scene rather than drag it out interminably
* changed it to an aura, and from save-every-round to a single save (much smoother gameplay)
* Added a certain number of compelled questions
