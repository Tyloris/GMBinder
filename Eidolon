### Evolution Pool

Points from this pool can be spent on a wide variety of modifications and upgrades that add new abilities, attacks, and powers to the eidolon.

The summoner can change them whenever he gains a level

### Darkvision
The Eidolon has a superior vision in dark and dim conditions. It can see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The Eidolon can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Link
At 1st level, A summoner and his eidolon share a mental link which allows for communication across any distance (as long as they are on the same plane). This communication is a free action, allowing the summoner to give orders to his eidolon at any time. In addition, magic items interfere with the summoner’s connection to his eidolon.

As a result, the summoner and his eidolon share magic item slots. The eidolon must possess the appropriate appendages to utilize a magic item.

### Share Spells
Starting at 2nd the summoner may cast a spell with a target of “self” on his eidolon (as a spell with a range of touch) instead of on himself. A summoner may cast spells on his eidolon even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the eidolon’s type. Spells cast in this way must come from the summoner spell list. This ability does not allow the eidolon to share abilities that are not spells, even if they function like spells

### Evasion
Beginning at 3rd level If an eidolon is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Dex save for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one of the Eidolon’s ability score of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
You can forgo the Ability score improvement in favor of a feat

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, the Eidolon can attack twice, instead of once, whenever it takes the Attack action on their turn.

### Devotion
At 6th level, the Eidolon gains advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Improved Evasion
Beginning at 14th level If an eidolon is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Dex save for half damage, an eidolon takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and only half damage if the saving throw fails
