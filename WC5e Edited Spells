## Spell Descriptions
The new spells are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Acid Rain
*5th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
___
Acid rain begins falling within a 40-foot-radius 60-foot-high cylinder centered on a point you choose within range. When a creature moves into the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 6d4 acid damage and become covered in acid. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage and is not covered in acid.

A creature takes 3d4 acid damage if it ends its turn while covered with acid. The target or a creature within 5 feet of it can end this damage by using its action to clear away the acid.

#### Aero Barrage
*4th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
___
You create four lances of rapidly spinning condensed wind and hurl them at targets within range. You can hurl them at one target or several. 

Make a ranged spell attack for each lance. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 slashing damage and is knocked 10 feet backwards.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you create one additional lance for each slot level above 4th.

#### Alextrasza’s Fury
*8th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot cone)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___
Your hands burst into flames as you push a roaring wave of fire outward from yourself. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 12d6 fire damage and is stunned until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and isn't stunned. The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried. A creature killed by this spell is reduced to ash.

\columnbreak

#### Amplify/Dampen Magic
*4th-level abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** S, M (something of value to the creature)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___
You manipulate the flow of mana rushing through a creature, if the creature is unwilling you must succeed on a melee spell attack before you can manipulate their flow. When you touch a creature with this spell, you choose which effect you want to affect the creature with for the spells duration.

***Amplify.*** You amplify a creatures magical prowess. The creature takes additional damage when hit by a spell, deals additional damage when casting a spell, and restores additional hit points to a creature with a spell by an amount equal to your spellcasting modifier.

***Dampen.*** You dampen a creatures magical prowess. The creature reduces damage taken by spells, damage dealt by spells, and the number of hit points restored to it by a spell by an amount equal to your spellcasting modifier.

#### Angelic Feather
*1st-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a feather)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___
You touch one creature within reach, granting it the swiftness of an angelic being. For the duration of the spell, the creature can take the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge action as a bonus action on its turn.

#### Animate Crawling Claw
*1st-level necromancy (ritual)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a used butcher's knife and a humanoid's hand, severed in the last 7 days)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___
You bind a severed hand to your will, haunting and animating it as a crawling claw (the GM has the creature's game statistics). The hand is under your control for 24 hours, after which the hand becomes inactive and can't be animated again. 

On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command the crawling claw. You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command for it to follow to the best of its understanding. If you issue no commands, the claw follows its last command to the best of its ability. Once given an order, the claw continues to follow it until its task is complete.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the crawling claw remains active for an additional 24 hours for every slot level above 1st. When cast using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the crawling claw remains active until slain.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___
You manifest twin bolts of raw force that streak in a double helix pattern towards a target you can see within range, causing the target to take 10d4 force damage. The target must then make a Strength save or be pushed up to 20 feet directly away from you.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a <br/> spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 4th.

#### Arcane Blast
*Evocation cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___

The elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. As long as the elemental is under your control, you maintain a telepathic link to it as long as it is within 90 feet. It obeys any verbal or mental commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. The GM has the elemental’s statistics. 

***At Higher Level:*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the elemental remains and follows your orders until destroyed.

If your concentration is broken, the undead creature doesn't disappear. Instead, you lose control of the undead creature, the undead spends the rest of the spell’s duration pursuing and attacking the nearest non-undead to the best of its ability. An uncontrolled undead creature can't be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.

The GM has the undead creature's statistics.

You attempt to bind an undead creature that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become bound to serve you for the duration of the spell. While the creature is bound, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two are you on the same plane of existence, which you can use to mentally issue commands (no action required).

It is under the Dungeon Master's control, but must follow your commands to the best of its ability for as long as it is bound to you. You might command the creature to attack an enemy, guard a location, or fetch an object. If the creature completes the command and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability. During combat, the creature rolls its own initiative and has its own turns.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

Each time the creature takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends. Once the spell has ended, the creature cannot be controlled again this way for 24 hours.

On a successful saving throw, the target creature takes half damage. The effigy's hit points then reach 0, and the effect of this spell ends.

Whenever the target creature is forced to make a saving throw to resist the effects of this spell, it momentarily senses the rough distance and direction to the effigy.

If the target is further than 1 mile from the effigy or on another plane of existence from it, they are immune to the effects of this spell, but the link still remains. If the target ever comes within 1 mile of the effigy or returns to the same plane of existence as it, they can once again be subject to the effects of this spell. 

The effect ends if the effigy's hit points reach zero, the destroy action is taken, or if the target creature dies. *Remove curse* or another similar effect of 3rd level or higher cast on either the effigy or the target will also sever the link between the two.

If you cast this spell and attempt to create an effigy of a creature while another effigy of that creature created by you still has hit points, the spell fails.

***At Higher Level.*** When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the effigy gains an additional 2d6 hit points per spell slot level above 3rd

- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___
You create a fist-sized glowing green stone in your hand. A creature can use its action to crush the stone, destroying it and regaining hit points equal to 1d10 + your spellcasting modifier. The stone loses its abilities if not used within 24 hours.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.

___
You condense your mana into a prepared gemstone, creating a reservoir of power to draw upon.

When you cast a spell of 5th level or below while holding this mana gem, you can choose not to expend the spell slot, instead drawing upon the mana contained within the gem to power the spell. 

The mana gem holds enough mana to power 40 spell levels worth of spells at creation. Each time you cast a spell using the mana gem, it loses a number of spell levels equal to the level of the spell cast. If the gem has less spell levels remaining than the level of the spell you are attempting to cast, the spell fails. You automatically know how many spell levels the mana gem has remaining when you touch it.

Only you can benefit from a mana gem you have created. If you cast this spell again, any currently created mana gem is instantly destroyed.

When the spell ends, each creature that been targeted by the spell is alerted that the spell has ended and which creature had been saved. The spell cannot alert or save creatures on another plane of existence than the material component.

If you cast this spell again, the effect of any previously cast create soulstone spell ends. The spell ends prematurely if its material component is ever not on your person. A creature can only benefit from one soulstone at a time.

Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the weapon must make a Constitution saving throw.

At the end of each Of its turns, a blinded creature can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Spell-Specific Changes
- Amplify or Dampen Magic renamed to Amplify/Dampen Magic, to match Enlarge/Reduce. Also lets it fit on one line in the spell lists.
- Arcane Barrage no longer requires an attack roll. Damage reduced from a max of 15d4 to 10d4. Knockback effect now tied to secondary Strength save, max knockback reduced from 30 feet to 20. Damage now increases by 2d4 per spell slot level.
- Arcane Blast no longer require a Dexterity save. Base damage changed to 1d4 + spellcasting ability modifier, increasing by 2d4.
- Army of the Dead changed to Silverblade's version.
- Bloodlust and Heroism drops the "and Heroism" part of its name, to avoid confusion with the existing spell.
- Cataclysm: hopefully cleared up [Issue #808](https://github.com/WC5E/Warcraft-5e-Conversion/issues/808) on the github by removing the word "spell" from the line "A creature who takes fire damage from this spell--"
- Conjure Undead (formerly known as Summon Undead) no longer allows you to choose which undead type you summon, like other conjure spells.
- Deathwyrm's Fury spell removed.
- Dominate Undead renamed to Control Undead, reworked so that it doesn't apply the charmed condition and therefore isn't functionally useless. Based on the conversation in [Issue #806](https://github.com/WC5E/Warcraft-5e-Conversion/issues/806).
- Eclipse altered. No longer references Elune and An'she, requires concentration, max duration increased to 8 hours, and reworded how darkness appears.
- Flurry spell removed.
- Lunar Strike no longer requires a saving throw. Damage changed to 1d4 to initial target (+1d4 if in moonlight) and half damage to all creatures in an AoE. 
- Mind blast reduced from d10 to d8 damage.
- Shadow bolt now always deals d12 damage with no optional self-damage component. Instead, you take 1 damage per 12 rolled on a die.

\pagebreak

## Design Notes
- Force damage spells that don't require saves to deal damage are designed to deal 25% less damage than average (using the rule of "spells that deal no damage on a successful save deal 25% more" from the DMG).
- Death Knights and Druids get poison damage spells. DKs because of plague, druids because of animal venom.

### Chaos "Element"
 Does not deal a predetermined damage type, instead rolling a d8 on a table to choose an element: acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, poison, psychic, or thunder. Typically has two different sets of damage dice (such as 2d8 + 2d6), where you choose one of the d8s for damage type. If the same number is rolled twice on one of the dice sets, an additional effect occurs.

#### Chaos Aura
*3rd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (15 feet)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___
You create a roiling aura of chaotic energies that stretches from you in a 15-foot radius. Until the spell ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you. 

Whenever another creature ends its turn in the aura or enters it for the first time on a turn, they must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 + 2d6 damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Choose one of the d8s whenever you deal damage. The number rolled on that die determines the type of the damage dealt, as shown below.

d8 |Damage Type |d8 |Damage Type
---|------------|---|-----------
1  | Acid		| 5 | Lightning
2  | Cold		| 6 | Poison
3  | Fire		| 7 | Psychic
4  | Force		| 8 | Thunder

**[Double die effect.]**

**[Can use a BA to buff other chaos spells? Can roll more d8s for sake of choosing damage types?]**

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the spell deals an additional 1d6 damage for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Chaos Breach
*5th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___
You launch an intense beam of chaotic energies at a target within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d8 + 5d6 damage, or half as much on a successful saving throw. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the spell's damage type, as shown below.

d8 |Damage Type |d8 |Damage Type
---|------------|---|-----------
1  | Acid		| 5 | Lightning
2  | Cold		| 6 | Poison
3  | Fire		| 7 | Psychic
4  | Force		| 8 | Thunder

If you roll the same number on both d8s, the spell deals an additional 2d8 damage to the target. Choose one of the d8s to determine the new damage type. This effect repeats until two different numbers are rolled.

Until the end of your next turn (including against this spell), the target is more susceptible to the spell's initial damage type. If the creature has immunity to this damage type, it is reduced to resistance, and if it has resistance, it is suppressed for the duration.

\columnbreak

#### Chaos Wave
*3rd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot cone)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___
You release a wave of chaotic energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a saving throw or take 2d8 + 2d6 damage and suffer an additional effect. A successful save results in half damage and no other effect. Choose one of the d6s and one of the d8s for each target. The number rolled on the d6 determines the spell's saving throw and additional effect and the number rolled on the d8 determines the spell's damage type, as shown below.

d6| Saving Throw | Additional Effect
--|--------------|---------
1 | Strength     | Pushed away from you a number of feet equal to 1d4 x 5. 
2 | Dexterity    | Knocked prone.
3 | Constitution | Stunned until the end of its next turn.
4 | Intelligence | Subtract 1d4 from the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.
5 | Wisdom       | Takes an additional 1d10 force damage.
6 | Charisma     | Subtract 1d4 from the next attack roll it makes before the end of your next turn.

**[Note that the above effects were pulled from a different homebrew. Some are clearly better than others, so needs to be reworked.]**

d8 |Damage Type |d8 |Damage Type
---|------------|---|-----------
1  | Acid		| 5 | Lightning
2  | Cold		| 6 | Poison
3  | Fire		| 7 | Psychic
4  | Force		| 8 | Thunder

#### Mass Teleport
*9th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, M (expensive component, consumed)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
This spell instantly transports you and any number of willing creatures and/or objects of your choice that you can see within range to a destination you select. All creatures and objects must be able to fit entirely inside a 300-foot cube. You can designate creatures and objects you cannot see as targets as long as they are within an object you can see; for example, creatures inside a building.

The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls d100 and consults the table.

##### Teleportation
| Familiarity | Mishap | Similar Area | Off Target | On Target |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Associated object | — | — | — | 01–100 |
| Very familiar | 01–05 | 06–13 | 14–24 | 25–100 |
| Seen casually | 01–33 | 34–43 | 44–53 | 54–100 |
| Viewed once | 01–43 | 44–53 | 54–73 | 74–100 |
| Description | 01–43 | 44–53 | 54–73 | 74–100 |
| False destination | 01–50 | 51–100 | — | — |

***Familiarity.*** "Associated object" means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich's secret tomb.

"Very familiar" is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. "Seen casually" is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar. "Viewed once" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. "Description" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.

"False destination" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.

***On Target.*** You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.

***Off Target.*** You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.

***Similar Area.*** You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.

***Mishap.*** The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).
