## Death Knight

<!--
*A hero... that's what you once were. You stood against the shadow, and purchased another dawn for this world at the cost of your life. But the evil you fought is not so easily banished, the victory you claimed not so easily held. The specter of death looms over this world again, it has found new champions to bring about its final reign. Knights of darkness, this is the hour of your dark rebirth . . .*

<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— A knight of the Ebon Blade* &nbsp;</div>

-->

*“All that I am: anger, cruelty, vengeance - I bestow upon you, my chosen knight. I have granted you immortality so that you may herald in a new, dark age for the Scourge.”*

<div style="text-align:Right"> 

— The Lich King's first words to a new death knight. &nbsp;</div>

<br/>

A human clad in heavy armor, wielding a greatsword with both hands, as he clutches it close, runes flash along its edge, leaving a stream of black smoke behind his swings.

An orc surrounded by kobolds, forces his axe into the ground as the earth around him withers and dies, fright&shy;ening the kobolds as they run for their life.

Biting cold rushes through the battle, as a lone blood elf walks forward, her armor clad in a layer of frost, she walks with firm steps, freezing the earth beneath her feet.

No matter their past calling, death knights serve the powers of death, wielding weapons infused with runes <br/> of power. They are ruthless and practical warriors resurr-ected by the powerful val'kyrs and granted the powers of the revered death knights of the Ebon Hold. Although these warriors seem dead at a glance, they are very much alive.

### Outcast for Life
Although these death knights are not undead as the genera-tions before them, they carry much of the essence of the knights that came before them, and from a distance have the look of a dead person, their blank white stares peering at the world around them. Even though they are alive and not emotionless, it means little to most they meet who shun them because of what they have become. Death knights are bringers of death and destroy, a fact not easily forgotten.

This has lead most death knights down a solitary path, many keep to the outskirts of towns and cities, or hide their appearance well before entering.

### Grim Revival
Being resurrected as a death knight is not a simple task, only complicated further by the scar it leaves on the newly resurrected, gaining the powers of the death knights weak-ens the soul for a tremendous time, a price that has to be paid. But not only does it drain the death knight, some scars are visible for all to see, their resurrection has
<br> filled their body with necrotic energy that will 
<br> forever linger within them, a trait always shown 
<br> through their eyes, which will forever sit as two 
<br> white lights in their sockets.

### Steadfast Warriors
Death knights are exceptional warriors, and in many ways similar to paladins, being keen with various weapons and able to fight in any armor, aiding their combat with the use of magic. They wield their empowered runic weapons and shadow magic which enables them to overpower most foes that would dare to stand against them, making them fearful fighters able to stand in any situation.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:670px;'></div>

### Creating a Death Knight
As you make your death knight character, spend some time thinking about how this path was granted to you. The vast majority of death knights were raised under the control of the Lich King and later broke their bonds of enslavement. Consider how this change has affected your character and their view of the world, do they show distance or interest in what happens around them? Think about what relations your character may have to their family, do they still exist? would they accept them as they are now, or would they shun and banish them for what they have become? Perhaps you were once a figure of importance, a leader to others or a soldier in an army.

Think about how this destiny came to be, how you died and what stories it may tell. Think about the effects having been raised into undeath may have done to you, what trans&shy;formation in personality might've occurred. What interests may have been lost from your previous life. Becoming a death knight is a reincarnation, one where you are trapped in your own body, with a new view of the world around you.

### Dark Rebirth
*1st-level death knight feature*
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

**[Lore text goes here.]**

Every death knight shares a number of physical traits: their eyes glow with a pale blue light, their body feels cool to the touch, and their voice gains a deep echo. Their emotions and memories from before they became a death knight are distant and dulled. They also gain an eternal hunger for causing suffering and death, an addiction that if not sated regularly will inevitably result in insanity.

___
As a death knight, you gain the following traits: 

***Undead Nature.*** Your creature type is undead, rather than humanoid. This renders you immune to certain spells, both beneficial and harmful, and makes you vulnerable to other spells and effects. See the Non-Humanoid Races sidebar on page **##** for more information.

You also gain the following traits:
- You are immune to non-magical poisons and diseases.
- You have advantage on death saving throws.
- You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.
- You no longer age and will not die from old age.
- You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in an inactive, motionless state, during which you retain consciousness.

##### Death Knight Quirks
d6| |Quirks
--|-|--------
1 || Your body temperature becomes arctic, causing your breath to fog and the air around you to gain a deep chill.
2 || Your presence feels unnatural, causing others to feel uneasy near you and animals such as dogs to become hostile.
3 || You gain a taste for food typically consumed by lower undead, such as humanoid flesh, vermin, and insects.
4 || Your memory of your previous life is especially dulled. Alternatively, it is almost entirely intact.
5 || You become obsessed with one particular food, drink, or hobby that you liked in life but can no longer enjoy.
6 || You are a little too comfortable with death and violence and have no problems with desecrating corpses and graveyards.

### Runic Magic
*1st-level death knight feature*
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

**[DK Spellcasting Flavor Intro.]**

#### Cantrips
You know two cantrips of your choice from the death knight spell list. You learn additional death knight cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Death Knight table.

#### Runeblade
You know how to inscribe magical runes onto a nonmagical weapon, transforming it into a runeblade—the source of your power. The ritual to do so takes 1 hour and consumes 50 gp worth of components. You can only have a single runeblade at a time. Bonding with a new weapon immediately breaks the bond with any previous runeblade.

Your weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

You can't be disarmed of your runeblade unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence as you, you can summon your runeblade as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand. **[TBH, I don't like this part. I'd rather you instinctually know which direction it is.]**

You produce your death knight rune effects through your runeblade. You must have your runeblade within 5 feet of you when using an ability that requires runic power.

#### Runes
Your runeblade is inscribed with a number of runes, each of which embodies a specific concept, such as Anger, Cruelty, or Vengeance. The number of runes inscribed on your runeblade is shown on the Inscribed Runes column of the Death Knight table. When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one rune you know with a different one of your choice.

#### Runic Power
You have a reservoir of energy drawn from your runes that can be used to power certain magical powers. This energy is represented by runic power. Each rune describes effects you can create with it by spending a certain amount of runic power.

The amount of runic power you have is based on your death knight level, as shown in the Runic Power column of the Death Knight table. The number shown for your level is your maximum runic power. Your runic power total returns to its maximum when you finish a short or long rest. The amount of runic power you have can't go below 0 or over your maximum.

<!--
#### Power Limit
Though you have access to a potent amount of runic power, it takes training and practice to channel that energy. There is a limit on the amount of runic power you can spend to activate a rune. The limit is based on your death knight level, as shown in the Power Limit column of the Death Knight table. For example, as a 5th-level death knight, you can spend no more than 3 runic power on a rune each time you use it, no matter how much runic power you have.
-->

#### Spellcasting Ability
Some rune abilities replicate spells or require an attack roll or saving throw. Charisma is your spellcasting ability, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a death knight spell you cast or ability your use and when making an attack roll with one.

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br> your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br> your Charisma modifier
</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Fighting Style
*2nd-level death knight feature*
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### Profane Warrior
You learn an additional two cantrips of your choice from the death knight spell list.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

> #### Optional Class Features
> See Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, Pg. 41 for additional Fighting Styles. The Interception, Superior Technique, and Unarmed Fighting styles are appropriate choices for this class.

<div style='margin-top:35px;'></div>

\columnbreak

### Rune Tap
*2nd-level death knight feature*
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You can invoke a rune to gain one of a following effects:
- ***Rune Tap.*** You can expend a rune as a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d12 + your death knight level.
- **Death Coil?**
- **Combine the above two, healing yourself with Death Coil, firing it as a beam, or using it as a smite?**
- **Death Grip?**

### UNKNOWN-3
*3rd-level death knight feature*
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You are now able to turn magical weapons into a runeblade. 

You can also inscribe a rune onto a second weapon, turning it into a lesser runeblade. As long as you are wielding your primary runeblade, this lesser runeblade counts as a magical weapon and you cannot be disarmed of it unless incapacitated. You can summon both weapons to your hands as part of the same bonus action.

### Knighthood
*3rd-level death knight feature* 
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You choose a path of knighthood to follow, focusing on a single rune's concept. You can choose to become a Knight of Blood, Knight of Frost, or Knight of the Unholy. Your choice of knighthood provides features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, and 15th level.

#### Knight Rune
Each Knighthood has an associated rune. You inscribe this rune onto your runeblade when you select your Knighthood path and it does not count against the number of runes you have inscribed. If you already have this rune, you can inscribe a different rune of your choice.

### Ability Score Improvement
*4th-level death knight feature*
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Deathly Versatility (Optional)
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one of the following, representing a change of focus:
- Replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to death knights.
- Replace one cantrip you learned from this class' Runic Magic feature with another cantrip from the death knight spell list.

### Extra Attack
*5th-level death knight feature*
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

\pagebreakNum

### Unearthly Presence
*6th-level death knight feature*
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

**[You get the presence of one rune you have inscribed. Can swap them out.]**

### UNKNOWN-9
*9th-level death knight feature*
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

### Aura of Dread
*10th-level death knight feature*
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

As long as you are conscious, whenever a creature within 10 feet of you targets you with an attack, they must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, they have disadvantage on the attack roll. A creature immune to the frightened condition is immune to this effect.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Knight of the Unholy
**Instead of a permanent ghoul, should the subclass have the ability to temporarily raise a dead enemy, like the hexblade?**

**Make this rune focus on the concept of unholiness, over disease or undead servants. Like inverted paladin and priest abilities, mockeries of the Light. Seems like the sort of thing Arthas would enjoy.**

***There still can be undead bolstering abilities and diseases, but as inverses of paladin abilities. Like Turn Undead becomes Bolster Undead, Lay on Hands becomes spreading disease, etc.***

Ice Spike (1-7 psi). As an action, you hurl a mote of ice at one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d8 cold damage per psi point spent and has its speed halved until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage.
Ice Sheet (2 psi). As an action, choose a point on the ground you can see within 60 feet of you. The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that point becomes covered in ice for 10 minutes. It is difficult terrain, and any creature that moves more than 10 feet on it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. If the surface is sloped, a creature that falls prone in the area immediately slides to the bottom of the slope.
Frozen Sanctuary (3 psi). As a bonus action, you sheathe yourself with icy resilience. You gain 20 temporary hit points.
Frozen Rain (5 psi; conc., 1 min.). As an action, choose a point you can see within 120 feet of you. The air in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point becomes deathly cold and saturated with moisture. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 6d6 cold damage, and its speed is reduced to 0 until your concentration ends. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.
As an action, a target that has its speed reduced can end the effect early if it succeeds on a Strength (Athletics) check with a DC equal to this effect's save DC.

You can increase this effect's damage by 1d6 per each additional psi point spent on it.

Ice Barrier (6 psi; conc., 10 min.). As an action, you create a wall of ice, at least one portion of which must be within 60 feet of you. The wall is 60 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall lasts until your concentration ends. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 12 and 30 hit points. A creature that damages the wall with a melee attack takes cold damage equal to the damage the creature dealt to the wall.

# Brainstormed Abilities
These are abilities that I've come up with or come across but have yet to add into the class.
- You are resistant/immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.
- You are immune to disease.
- You have advantage on saving throws against exhaustion.
- You have advantage on saving throws against being turned.
- [Carrion Eater.](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Ghoul_(5e_Race)) You gain nutrition from corpses, ignoring any detriment. You may consume dead or rotting bodies and flesh to fulfill your food requirement, and you are immune to any diseases or effects that would render you poisoned when you do so.
- [Departed Voice.](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Ghoul_(5e_Race)) After you consume a corpse, you can mimic the voice or sounds which the body spoke with when alive. For example, if it was a beast, you can now mimic its growls and snarls unerringly. This effect lasts until the end of a long rest. If you consume another corpse, you replace the previous voice you could mimic. A creature that hears the sounds you make can tell they are imitations with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check opposed by your Charisma (Deception) check.
- [Corpse Finder.](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Dhamyre_(5e_Race)) Whenever you make an intelligence (History) check related to the location of a burial ground or graveyard, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus. Additionally, you have advantage in Wisdom (Survival) checks to locate corpse remains.
- ***Death's Advance.*** Your approach is as inevitable as death itself. Your movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects cannot reduce your speed.
- ***Rune of the Fallen Crusader.*** When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with or roll a natural 20 on an attack roll with your runeblade, you can cast *heroism* on yourself without expending a spell slot. **(I like the parallel of "Fallen Crusader" and casting a normally bard/paladin only spell.)**
- ***Endurance.*** When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Constitution saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. 
- ***Lichborne.*** You can't be charmed or frightened, and you have advantage on saving throws against effects that specifically target undead, such as a priest's Turn Undead or the *shackle undead* spell.
- ***Purgatory.*** *Prerequisite: 11th level* If you drop to 0 hit points and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. In addition, you no longer fall unconscious when reduced to 0 hit points. You still die if you fail 3 death saving throws. // Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10. // **Level requirement is based on the barbarian's Relentless Rage, which this is a copy of.**
- ***Rune of Spellbreaking.*** *Prerequisite: 14th level* When you deal damage with your runeblade to a creature who is concentrating on a spell, they have disadvantage on the saving throw to maintain concentration. // In addition, you can expend one runic power to end one spell on yourself as an action. // **I left the old version of this in as an example. Needs rework to fit the new runic magic model.**
- ***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point instead.
- ***Rune of Unending Thirst.*** Your movement speed increases by 10 feet. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, or when you expend a runic power as a bonus action, you can move up to your speed towards a hostile creature you can see.
- ***Undead Nature.*** You don‘t require air, food, drink, or sleep. You are also immune to nonmagical
poisons and diseases, and have advantage to effects that cause the exhausted and poisoned
conditions.
- **Diseases.** Make them part of the core class? Make you a natural carrier for disease?

***Spellbreaking Strike.*** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend an amount of runic power to deal force damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 1d4 per runic power expended, to a maximum of 5d4. The target

***Antimagic Shell.***

***Greater Invocation: Antimagic Zone.*** As an action, you can create an immobile, faintly shimmering barrier that springs into existence in a 10-foot radius around you and remains for 1 minute. 

Any spell of 4th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells.

***Runic Empowerment.*** While this rune is empowered, 

***Retribution (2 RP).*** Whenever a creature you can see deals damage to you or an ally, you can use your reaction to move up to your speed towards them. If this movement brings you within reach, you can make one melee attack against them.

***Vengeful Fury (5 RP; conc., 1 min.).*** You cause a creature's rage to grow so hot that it attacks without heeding its own safety. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or, until your concentration ends, any creature within 5 feet of it can use a reaction to make a melee attack against it whenever the target makes a melee attack. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed.
