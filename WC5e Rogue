## Rogue
*You're gonna find a number of outfits that covet our skills. Adventurers, SI:7... heck, even the disorganized rabble wouldn't mind a spy or two inside Stormwind. But you remember this: You're your own man. Don't let nobody bully you into doing something you don't wanna do! Besides, we hold all the cards... at least, we do before the game's done.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Jorik Kerridan*  </div>

Signaling for her companions to wait, a female orc creeps forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of tools to pick it in the blink of an eye. Before disappearing into the shadows as her warrior friend moves forward to kick the door open.

A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, and the assassin's blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound.

Suppressing a giggle, a gnome silently sneaks up behind a guard, lifting the key ring from the his belt. In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are free to make their escape.

Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:241px'></div>

### A Simple Code
For rogues, the only code is the contract, and their honor is purchased in gold. Free from the constraints of a conscience, these mercenaries rely on brutal and efficient tactics. Lethal assassins and masters of stealth, they will approach their marks from behind, piercing a vital organ and vanishing into the shadows before the victim hits the ground. Rogues can dip their weapons in paralyzing toxins that render foes unable to defend themselves. These silent stalkers wear leather armor so they can move unencumbered, ensuring that they land the first strike.

With the rogue’s poisons and speed, the first strike is often the last step before the killing blow.

Rogues fend for themselves, looking for fights in which they dictate the terms. They’re the shadows in the night that remain unseen until the right moment comes to strike, then they dispatch an opponent with quick blade work or a deadly toxin snuck acutely into the bloodstream. Rogues are opportunistic thieves, bandits, and assassins, but there’s an unparalleled art to what they do.

### Skill and Precision
Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.

When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.

### Creating a Rogue
As you create your rogue character, consider the charac-ter's relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past, or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves' guild master? or did you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventurers, or some other desire or ideal?

What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life.

    Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend, who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.

#### Quick Build
You can make a rogue quickly by following these sugges­tions. First, Dexterity should be your highest ability score. Make intelligence your next highest if you want to excel at Investigation. Choose Charisma instead if you plan to emphasize deception and social interaction.

#### Optional Rule: Multiclassing
If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the *Player's Handbook*, here's what you need to know if you choose rogue as one of your classes.

***Ability Score Minimum.*** As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Dexterity score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a rogue.

***Proficiencies Gained.*** If rogue isn't your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a rogue: light armor, one skill from the class's skill list, thieves' tools.

### Expertise

You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a light, finesse, or ranged weapon.

You don't need advantage on the attack if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapa­citated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.

### Secret Missives

<div style="margin-top: -4px"></div>

During your rogue training you learned how to conceal messages, instructions, and simple ideas in plain sight. You do so by weaving subtle jargon and motions in seemingly normal dialogue, sharing statements with hidden meanings or even by writing cryptic code.

You can use 4 hours to share a set of such rules with another creature, allowing you to weave secret messages and commands in your conversations and letters. More elaborate rules may require an Intelligence check at your DM's discretion.

### Cunning Action
<i>2nd-level rogue feature</i>
<div style="margin-top: -4px"></div>

Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

### Talents
*2nd-level rogue feature*
<div style="margin-top: -4px"></div>

???

***Talents Known.***

***Saving Throws.*** Some of your Talents require a saving throw. The DC for this saving throw is calculated as follows:

</div>

You learn additional Sinister Strikess as you gain rogue levels, as detailed in the "Sinister Strikess Known" column of the rogue table. 

Additionally, when you finish a long rest, you can change one known Sinister Strikes to another one you can know, as long as you fulfill the required level prerequisite. 

***Using a Sinister Strike.*** When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can add one of the following Sinister Strikes effects. Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of Sneak Attack damage dice you must forego to add the effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the effect occurs immediately after the attack's damage is dealt. For example, if you add the Garrote effect, remove 1d6 from the Sneak Attack's damage before rolling

***Saving Throws.*** Some of your Sinister Strikes require a Saving Throw. The DC for this Saving Throw is calculated as follows:

<font face='scalysans' size='2'>
 
<center> 
 
**Finisher save DC** </font> = <font face='scalysans' size='2'> 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
 
</center>
 
<div style='margin-top:-8px'></div>
 
<center> your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier (your choice) </center>

</font>

<div style="margin-top: -4px"></div>

You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an *ice storm* spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Reliable Talent
<i>7th-level rogue feature</i>
<div style="margin-top: -4px"></div>

You have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

\pagebreakNum

<div style="margin-top: -4px"></div>

You gain an additional bonus action you can use on your turn. You can use this bonus action only for your Cunning Action feature, and can't use both bonus actions to take the same action twice on the same turn.
