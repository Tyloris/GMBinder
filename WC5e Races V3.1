## Things to help out with
The Broken do not currently have any features. They need about four features to match up with the other draenei, none of which should deal with the Light. Their main themes are: 
- **Hardiness.** They have to endure being cut off from the Light, which they spent their whole (sometimes 1000s of years long) life being guided by. The ones who couldn't handle it have died off, leaving only the most enduring.
- **Survival.** They are practically exiled from draenei society, having to live in the wilderness and wastes.
- **"Magical Alzheimer's."** They are gradually forgetting what it felt like to be connected to the Light. Could either be a gradual degeneracy like blood elves' Wretched and nightborne's Withered, or just naturally forgetting what your parent's faces looked like after they've been dead for years.
- **Melancholy.** They've lost so much that it leads to a generally Eeyore-like personality. Similar to LotR elves, in how they bemoan how the world has been declining. A possible ability would be the equivalent of using a depression power on someone already depressed.

### 
The Lightforged have the aasimar's transformation ability, which felt appropriate. I'm not wild about just copy-pasting their specific transformations; is it possible to come up with ones more thematically appropriate?

## Second pass tasklist
- Condense the number of traits. An example: Wildhammer dwarves have 10 traits in total.
- Consider what races should get darkvision.
- What traits would be better off as racial feats?
- Check for overlap between racial features. What needs to be unique, what can be shared?
- Which racial features are too common? Examples are advantages on saves against certain features or additional skill proficiencies.
- Add a Highborne subrace for night elves? Or just point at blood elves?
- Add some sort of Mag'har variant for orcs?
- Simplify the gnomish tinkering trait.

##### Potential Alternate Abilities
- Instead of pure advantage, rolling d4 on specific ability or tool checks. It would break up cases where there are too many races with advantage on this or that.
- Borrow from the Eberron Dragonmark features: "If you have the Spellcasting or the Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the XXXX Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class.""
- Using the hobgoblin trait from Eberron: "**Martial Training.** You are proficient with two martial weapons of your choice and with light armor." Particularly as a racial feat for some of the human kingdoms, as a sort of militia training thing.
- From Eberron again, specifically the Mark of the Sentinel human: "**Vigilant Guardian.** When a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to swap places with that creature, and you are hit by the attack instead. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest." Works pretty well as a human racial feat.

# Worgen
### Worgen Traits
Your worgen character has the following racial traits.

***Creature Type.*** You are a Humanoid. You are also considered a worgen and a shapeshifter for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be either. 

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2.

***Age.*** Worgen age like they did before becoming cursed, but even though their bodies continue to age, they never feel the strain of old age, and continue to fight as if they were a young pup. 

***Alignment.*** Worgen tend to become chaotic, the infection of their blood with the wolves making them more unpredictable.

***Size.*** Worgen vary in height and build like uncursed members of their race. Their cursed form is typically a third larger in girth and height than their uncursed form. Your size is Medium. 

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Aberration.*** You have advantage on saves against curses and diseases. You count as an Aberration for purposes of animating undead. **[Instead of counting as an aberration, should it just require a spell slot of, say, 6th level or higher?]**

**_Two Forms._** You are the master of your curse, able to transform from your worgen form to your former uncursed form at will over 1 minute. You can transform back into your worgen form as an action. If you die while in your uncursed form, you revert to your worgen form after death. You gain certain the following racial traits when you are in worgen form:
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>
 
- **Claws.** You can use your claws to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
- **Climb.** Your sharp claws gives you a climbing speed equal to your movement speed.
- **Darkflight.** Your reflexes and agility allow you to move with a burst of speed. When you move on your turn in combat, you can double your speed until the end of the turn. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you move 0 feet on one of your turns.
- **Darkvision.** Accustomed to the black nights, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
- **Keen Hearing and Smell.** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception), Wisdom (Survival), and Intelligence (Investigation) checks that involve hearing or smell.
- **Running Wild.** When running on all fours, you can move faster over long distances. When calculating travel pace, you can use twice your movement speed. 
- **Standing Leap.** Your long jump is equal to your movement speed and your high jump is equal to 2/3 your movement speed, rounded down to the nearest 5 foot increment, with or without a running start. **[Simplify the math?]**
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

***Former Life.*** The worgen curse can affect a number of differing types of humanoids, but the two most common are those who were formerly human or night elves. Choose one of the following.

#### Worgen Human
The vast majority of modern worgen were former humans, and the vast majority of those are composed of the former people of the kingdom of Gilneas. You were either infected by the curse through the bite or blood of a worgen or you were cursed directly by the Scythe of Elune. Either way, you owe your sanity to the night elves and their usage of the powerful artifact.

***Creature Type.*** You are also considered a human for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be a human.

***Ability Score Increase.*** One other ability score of your choice increases by 1.

***Human Spirit.*** When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die. You must use the new result, even if it is a 1.

***???.*** [Add another trait here, to balance out the number of traits between humans and night elves? See the Forsaken Human for inspiration.]

#### Worgen Night Elf
A smaller number of night elves have been infected by the worgen curse. Either you were one of the first druids to be transformed, one of their victims throughout the thousands of years since their creation, or your transformation may have been a recent case due to the creation of the Ritual of Balance that allows you to retain your sanity.

***Creature Type.*** You are also considered an elf for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be an elf.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 1.

***Fleet of Foot.*** Your base movement speed increases to 35 feet.

***Superior Darkvision.*** You retain your darkvision whether in your worgen or uncursed form. Its range increases to 120 feet and instead of shades of gray the world is tinted red.

## Orc
*To pretend the demonic corruption did not exist is to forget how dreadful the impact was. To make ourselves into victims, rather than claiming our participation in our own destruction. We chose this path, we orcs. We chose it right up until it was too late to turn back. And having made that choice, we can, with the knowledge that we have of the end of that dark and shameful road, choose not to take it.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Warchief Thrall* &nbsp;</div>
<div style='margin-top:-5px'></div>

When the orcs were freed from the Burning Legion, they experienced a spiritual revolution as the unnatural blood&shy;lust left their bodies, connecting them with states of heart and mind that were common to their ancestors. This new generation of orcs for the most part followed Thrall as he forged the Horde through shamanism and tribal traditions.

Though prone to fits of rage in warfare, orcs tend to display a curious feral grace that can rival even the finest fencing of an elven noble. The orcs of today continue to stand in drastic contrast to those that were enslaved by the Burning Legion, who embodied a bestial and diabolical force which was barely being controlled by warlock magic.

### Mindful Individuals
To orcs, prowess in battle bestows great personal honor on an individual. This notion of honor pervades every echelon of orcish culture, and the loss or gain of honor has equal consequence to all orcs regardless of their stature. 

Even the naming of orcs is temporary until they have performed rites of passage; only when orcs bring honor to themselves and thus to their clan do elders grant them adult names based upon their deeds. Orcs may appear quick to anger but they are tempered by the wisdom of <br> the shamans, who are revered across Horde society.

While many in the Alliance still perceive the orcs as brutish or even mindless, they have forged a complex culture embracing many occupations and many different races. No doubt Thrall's leadership aided in bringing this about, yet it is apparent that the Alliance has underesti&shy;mated the orcs' ability to construct a society that is highly influential in world affairs.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:595px;'></div>

### A Spiritual Connection
As far back as orcish history has been recorded, shaman have been mentioned, and learning to speak with the elemental spirits of Draenor was a pivotal achievement in destiny for the orc clans. The first orcs to learn the ways of shamanism hailed from the Shadowmoon clan, but many clans claim the mythical "First Shaman" arose from their ranks, even though the truth is that no one is sure of his or her allegiance.

Several orc shaman worship or at least acknowledge <br> the Earth Mother, the benevolent creator deity primarily worshipped by the tauren.

### Frightful Appearance
Orc males are massive and brutish looking creatures. Weighing in at 250 to 350 pounds and standing from 6 to 7 feet in height, they are not a small race. Even orc women tend to be only a half-foot or so shorter than most males, having broad shoulders and muscular, powerful bodies.

Orcs tend to have bristly hair and beards, often black or brown in color. Their skin ranges from a light green to a dark drab olive. Eyes range in color from a fierce red to a pale blue. Orcs have broad, flat noses, tusk-like teeth jutting from their lower and sometimes upper jaws, and large, pointed ears. They favor clothes of hide, and armor and arm themselves with a variety of gear.

<div style='margin-top:370px;'></div>

### Affiliation
Orcs are members of the Horde and it would not exist with&shy;out them. They forged the Orcish Horde prior to the First War and the New Horde—also known as the Horde—during the Third War as the orcs made a lasting bond with races native to the continent of Kalimdor. Much of the Horde continues to be influenced by orcish culture and laws.

Although most orcs are members of the Horde, there are those who chose to isolate themselves from its influence and affiliated races. These reclusive clans are rarely friendly towards the Horde or its races and some show open hostility.

### Orc Names and Clans
Most orcish names derive from words in their language that have some complex meaning or hidden significance to their families. Typically, this is the name of a favorite thing or relative. Family names don’t exist; most orcs have last names related to some great deed of heroism or honor.

Orcs typically form into similarly minded groups known as clans. Each clan is lead by a chieftain and the leader of all clans is known as the Warchief, a title given to the leader of the current Horde. Some clans are ancestral and well-established, while others were established relatively recently by specific people for a specific purpose. In the latter case, loyalty is typically only held to the clan leader; once they die, the clan disperses.

The clan system has largely been abolished during the reign of Thrall as the Warchief in favor of a single Horde. Still, there are some who proudly bear the name of ancient clans or follow their ways. Below are seven orc clans who have been major players in the history of both Azeroth and Draenor, though many more exist.
<div style='margin-top:-18px;'></div>

<br>**Male Names:** Grom, Thrum, Drog, Gorrum, Harg, Thurg, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karg, Regg, Kavenk, Uketel, Thrarturg, Crurn
<br>**Female Names:** Groma, Hargu, Igrim, Agra, Dragga, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grima, Fehmo, Mohma, Sherge, Zuri, Orgis
<br>**Deed Names:** Cravensmile, Steelflame, Twinthunder, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gravepride, Aridfire, Coldbrass, Foebinder, Elfkiller

\columnbreak

#### Blackrock
The Blackrock are a disciplined, organized, and 
<br/> militaristic clan who boast expert smiths and 
<br/> metalworkers who utilize the tough ore from 
<br/> which they share their name. The Blackrock 
<br/> shamans used elemental forges and were the 
<br/> first to descend into using fel magic during the 
<br/> First and Second Wars.

Blackrock orcs typically have gray-hued skin from their time living under mountains. Male orcs of the Blackrock Clan never cut their hair until they come of age, at which point their head is shaved and their role in this extremely regimented society is determined.

The Blackrocks follow the ways of either a mystic or warrior clan.

#### Bleeding Hollow
The Bleeding Hollow gain their name from the 
<br/> ritual performed by their chieftains and elders, 
<br/> where they ritualistically gouge out an eye in 
<br/> exchange for visions of the future, often of the 
<br/> time of their death. 

Hailing from the jungles of old Draenor, they 
<br/> imbue themselves with berserk fury, slather their 
<br/> weapons in hallucinogenic venom, and stalk prey from the treetops, branding their victims' final moments with visions of pure horror.

The orcs of the Bleeding Hollow follow the ways of the hunter and mystic clans.

#### Frostwolf
The Frostwolves are known for two things: their prowess in single combat and their close bonds with the wolves with which they share their name. Though smaller than many other orc clans, it is from this clan that the first leader of the Horde known as Thrall was descended. 

No two creatures will share a stronger relationship than that of a Frostwolf orc and his or her companion wolf. The two eat, sleep, and fight side by side until one or both dies an honorable death. Even then, sometimes not even death itself can stop a frostwolf from coming to the aid of its beloved orc.

The Frostwolves follow the ways of hunter and warrior clans.

#### Shadowmoon
These highly spiritual and shamanistic orcs come from Shadowmoon Valley in old Draenor and their magic was derived from the moon, earth, and stars. A key source of their power was their understanding of the movements of the stars and their omens. Their skin was often marked with bone-white tattoos of secret runes used to enhance their connections to the elements and their ancestors.

Despite these peaceful origins, it was the Shadowmoon chieftain Ner'zhul who led the orcs in the second invasion of Azeroth, who created so many portals on Draenor that the planet was shattered into the broken Outland, and whose spirit was twisted by the demon Kil'jaeden into becoming the Lich King. Due to his actions, very few Shadowmoon orcs remain.

Orcs of the Shadowmoon clan almost exclusively follow the path of a mystic clan.

### Forsaken Traits
Your forsaken character has the following racial traits.

***Creature Type.*** You are an Undead.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2.

***Alignment.*** When brought back to undeath, forsaken keep the alignment they had in life. However, most tend to become more chaotic and very few keep a good alignment after decades of being an undead.

***Size.*** Forsaken stand as tall as they did in life and weigh between half as much to as much as they did in life. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** Born into undeath by unholy magic, you can see normal in dark and dim conditiions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Cannibalize.*** You can consume the flesh of corpses to repair your injuries. For every minute you spend doing so, you can spend a Hit Die, roll it, and regain a number of hit points equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point). 

You can only do so using corpses that are mostly intact and have a true anatomy (for example, you may not con&shy;sume oozes). A typical fresh Medium corpse can be fed upon for five minutes, after which it is stripped of flesh.

***Grave's Rest.*** When you take a long rest, you spend at least 6 hours performing light activities instead of sleeping.

***Living Dead.*** You have resistance to poison damage and immunity to disease, and you have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned. You don't need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep.

Additionally, you benefit from certain spells that normally don’t affect undead: spells that restore hit points, though these feel immensely painful to you; spells that return dead creatures to life, though these instead return you to undeath; and spells that stabilize dying creatures.

~~***Pained by the Light.*** Whenever you take radiant damage, you must make a Constitution saving throw to avoid being wracked by pain, becoming stunning them until the start of their next turn. The saving throw DC is 10 or half the radiant damage taken, whichever is higher.~~

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language determined by your subrace.

***Subrace.*** Two subraces of forsaken are found among the undead of Lordaeron: forsaken humans and forsaken elves. Choose one of these subraces.

\columnbreak

#### Forsaken Human
As a forsaken human, you were once a human of the proud nation of Lordaeron. Raised as a minion to the Scourge as it passed through and leveled the kingdom with the ground.

#### Forsaken Elf
As a forsaken elf, you were once a high elf of Quel'thalas who died to the Scourge as it crawled through the land on its journey towards the Sunwell.

You can use your Banshee's Wail a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

***Languages.*** You can also speak, read, and write Thalassian, the language of the blood elves.

\pagebreak

##### Potential Alternate Abilities
Ideas pulled from [this homebrew](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/7q2el3/warcraft_5e_races_looking_for_some_feedback/)
- Forsaken humans gain a False Appearance trait to appear like a corpse when motionless
- Forsaken elves have a banshee's wail ability instead of spellcasting, dealing scaling psychic damage in a cone. Note: The 3rd level spell *fear* works pretty well as an equivalent to a banshee wail (frightening creatures in a 30 foot cone). It might be a good upgrade via a racial feat.
- Can put in a vulnerability to radiant damage to balance out the race.

##### Other
***Forsaken Versatility.*** Choose one of the following traits:

- **Corpselike (General).**

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Goblin Rocket Science.*** Using superior goblin engineering, you can utilize the destructive potential of rockets to assist you in combat, using the following options: 
- **Rocket Barrage.** When you take the attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a barrage of rockets affecting a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 fire damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).
- **Rocket Jump.** As a bonus action, you can use rockets to give yourself a boost, allowing you to jump a number of feet equal to five times your proficiency bonus, without costing movement or provoking opportunity attacks.

You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 

You can also try to use this trait when you have no uses by rolling a d6. If the result is 4 or higher, you successfully use it. Otherwise, your rocket fuel explodes, knocking you prone and dealing fire damage equal to your level to you and each creature within 5 feet of you, and you cannot try to use it again until you finish a long rest.

***Prepared for Failure.*** Goblin technology has such a propensity for explosive failure that dodging on a moment's notice has become second nature. When you fail a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your reaction to roll a d4 and add it to the save, potentially turning the failure into a success. You can't use this reaction if you are prone or your speed is 0.

***Tool Proficiency.*** You gain proficiency with the artisan's tools of your choice: alchemist's supplies, engineer's tools, or tinker's tools.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 1, and your Intelligence score increases by 2.

***Age.*** Nightborne reach physical maturity at the pace of humans, but the nightborne understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth. Nightbornes typically claim adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100, and can live to become thousands of years old.

***Magic Resistance.*** You have advantage on saving throws against spells.

***Mental Spellbook.*** You have proficiency in the Arcana skill.

Memorizing a spell, or inscribing your memorized spells into a physical spellbook, still takes the normal amount of time and material components.

Additionally, whenever you finish a long rest, you can select one cantrip from the mage spell list. You know that spell until the end of your next long rest. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it (choose when you select this race).

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Shalassian. Shalassian, like Thalassian, originates from the Darnassian language. Its dialect has been scrutinized through the ages, making it nearly impossible for members outside of the Nightborne to read or write.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Pandaren. Pandaren is the language of Pandaria, a descendant of the Mogu language forced upon the inhabitants of Pandaria by the mogu empire. It is a strange and unfamiliar language to the rest of Azeroth, with a multitude of words meaning one common thing.

If a creature is affected by multiple instances of this ability, they can only use the highest roll. You must be conscious and not frightened to use this ability.

### Light's Reckoning
*Prerequisite: Draenei (lightforged)*

When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to drop to 1 hit point instead, causing your body to erupt with holy light. Each other creature that is within 30 feet either regains hit points or takes radiant damage (your choice) equal to 2d10 + your level. You then gain 1 level of exhaustion. Once you use this reaction, you can’t do so again until you finish 1d4 long rests.

Choose one of the wrath options below. Thereafter, you can use a bonus action to unleash the celestial energy within yourself, gaining the benefits of that wrath. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. Once you transform using your wrath below, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

- **Forged in the Light.** Armor composed of pure light surrounds you. If your Armor Class is less than 20, it increases to 20 for the duration. Until the transformation ends, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra damage equals your proficiency bonus.
- **Hope of the Light.** Glowing symbols surround you, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet for the duration. You, and each allied creature within 10 feet of you, are immune to the frightened condition and gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus at the beginning of your turn. Until the transformation ends, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra damage equals your proficiency bonus.
- **Wings of Light.** Two luminous, spectral wings sprout from your back temporarily. Until the transformation ends, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and once on each of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra damage equals your proficiency bonus.

### Quaking Palm
*Prerequisite: Pandaren*

You are able to target focal points on a target. As a bonus action, you can make a special unarmed attack. If the attack hits, it deals no damage and the target falls unconscious for 1 minute. The target wakes up early if they take damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake.

### Shadowmeld
*Prerequisite: Night elf*

As a bonus action, you can magically turn invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack, make a damage roll, or force someone to make a saving throw. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
