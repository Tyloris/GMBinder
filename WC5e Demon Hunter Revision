## Demon Hunter
*The enemy came into our world, desiring to extinguish all life. They slaughtered our loved ones, razed our homes..  our cities. You could not stop them. So you came to me, nothing but rage and determination left, I taught you that what once tormented you could give you power.*

*Now you know, no sacrifice is too great if it brings an end to the Burning Legion*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Illidan Stormrage* &nbsp;</div>

A lone night elf clutching a pair of curved blades, peers to the ground as enemies surround him on all sides, before leaping backwards over the heads of his enemies, swinging his swords at one of them in the process.

A blood elf sprints to the distant aid of her allies, a pair of heavy warglaives in her hands, she releases the fel within, leaving a trail of fel in her path as she rushes in inhumane speed to their aid to jump on the nearest enemy.

A heavily built human standing afar as his allies engage a massive demon, in two swift motions he effortlessly slings his warglaives through the air at the demon, making deep gauges in its hide before returning to his firm grasp.

These hunters have sworn their life to a sacred cause, al-though their motivation may vary, demon hunters are one of Azeroths protectors, these agile hunters carry exceptio-nal skill against the foe they face. They wield both mortal strength and the devastating effects of fel magic, carrying out both with extreme precision

### Feared and Revered
Society often shun demon hunters. Most don't understand the sacrifice that they make, therefore, many choose to become outcasts from their societies. Eyes are commonly turned at them when they wade through towns, most distrust and fear them for what they have become.

Even though the world are untrusting of demon hunters, it matters not the the hunter themselves, cause they are protectors of the common folk against threats wishing the destruction of Azeroth, and most importantly demon. They are not righteous like paladins that fight for the Holy Light, or selfless like some rogues and warriors. They are the force who battles evil and although shunned by common folk, their aid is appreciated by experienced fighters.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:540px;'></div>

### Power Granted for a Price
Demon hunters are not trained like warriors are, they are created. It is a harsh and incurable process, leaving scars on the individual that will never heal. Most who attempt to undergo the rites to become a demon hunter end up dying from the horrors of what now possess them, or kills them-selves because of what they have seen. 

At the very core of becoming a demon hunter is the con&shy;sumption of a demon's soul in a ceremony, forever binding it to the demon hunter and suppressing it from taking control through magical inscriptions on the hunters skin, infused with fel. Finishing the binding of soul to the demon hunter by burning out their eyes with a magically imbued blade, forever binding the chaotic soul of the demon to the hunter. Other processes are done to create a demon hunter, slowly creating a fully fleshed demon hunter by removing much of who they were in their past lives.

### Creating a Demon Hunter
As you make your demon hunter character,  consider why your character decided to undergo the deadly rituals. Were your family slaughtered by demons of the Burning Legion? Did you strive for greater power through fel and how to control it? Were you full of rage and anger and wished to put it to use beyond raw strength? Perhaps you went through their rituals unwillingly, and by a miracle survived the demons attempts to take control? Think of the demon hunters that put you through the rituals and did the rites on you, your relationship to them, are you angry at them for what they have done? pleased with their accomplishment?

Starting when you choose this mark at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill if you don't already have it. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses this proficiency.

#### Torment
*3rd-level Mark of Vengeance feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You gain the ability to torment a creature. You can use your action and choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your fel save DC or have dis&shy;advantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

Torment ends early on the target if you use this ability on a different creature.

#### Demon Spikes
*6th-level Mark of Vengeance feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

Your demon form is empowered by your demon mark, giving you resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage while in metamorphosis. Also while in metamorphosis, you have advantage on Strength and Dexterity checks and saving throws.

#### Immolation Aura
*10th-level Mark of Vengeance feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You can spend 2 fel points as a bonus action to wreathe your body in flames of fel. When you activate this aura, and at the beginning of each of your turns for its duration, you take 1d6 fire damage. Immo&shy;lation aura lasts for 1 minute, until you end it as a bonus action, or until you are knocked unconscious.

Whenever a creature hits you with a melee attack for the duration of immulation aura, you deal fire damage to that creature equal to 1d6 + half your Demon Hunter level.

#### Last Resort
*17th-level Mark of Vengeance feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You are able to draw life from your demon mark to escape death. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can expend 1 fel point (no action required) to have 1 hit point instead and enter your metamorphosis until the end of your next turn.

### Mark of Wrath
Wrath demon hunters draws upon the chaotic energies infused on their skin, twisting the chaos into flames of fel that they can unleash upon a target from afar. They harness the destructive fel into ruthless display of power and agony. These demon hunters are rarely show the same hunger as other 'new' Illidari, they are hunters with a prey in mind, a person whom they won't stop for until they are no more.

#### Bonus Proficiency
*3rd-level Mark of Wrath feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill if you don't already have it. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses this proficiency.

#### Fel Sorcery
*3rd-level Mark of Wrath feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You can augment your combat techniques with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 6 for the warlock spell list.

***Spell Slots.*** The The Mark of Wrath Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 8th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell *Witch Bolt*, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.

***Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher.*** At 3rd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Mark of Wrath Spellcasting table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 11th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class and mark, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<div style="text-align: center">

**Spell save** DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

#### Chaos Flames
*3rd-level Mark of Wrath feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You learn to manifest raw flames of fel. You gain a new attack option that you can use in place of any weapon attack. This special attack is a ranged weapon attack with a range of 60/120 feet. You are proficient with it and add your choice of your Dexterity or Intelligence mod&shy;ifiers to its attack and damage rolls. On a successful hit, this special attack deals 1d8 fire damage.

At 11th level, the damage of your Chaos Flames increase to 1d10 fire damage.

#### Fiery Brand
*6th-level Mark of Wrath feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

Your metamorphosis empowers the chaos flames you wield. Whenever you hit a creature with a Chaos flame attack granted by your Demon's Bite, the crea&shy;ture must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have dis&shy;advantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn.

Additionally, while in your metamorphosis, fire damage dealt by chaos flames ignores resistance to fire and treats immunity as resistance for the purpose of damage.

#### Consume Magic
*10th-level Mark of Wrath feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You are able to interfere with and absorb magic. As an action, you can spend 2 fel points to create the effects of a *dispel magic* spell. When you dispel an effect this way, you gain temporary hit points equal to twice the spell's level + your Intelligence modifier. These hit points remain until you finish your next short or long rest.

You can also expend a spell slot as an action to regain a number of hit points equal to twice the spell slot's level + your Intelligence modifier. If the hit points restored would go over your maximum hit points, the excess healing is gained as temporary hit points that last until your next short or long rest.

\columnbreak

#### Fel Barrage
*17th-level Mark of Wrath feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You can release a torrent of chaos flames at targets near you. You can use your action and expend 1 to 5 fel points, releasing a barrage of chaos flames at creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you. Each creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d8 fire damage and 1d8 force damage for each fel point spend, or half as much damage on a successful one.

<!-- @Contributor The Vengeance demon hunter has been noted to be kind of squishy in the earlier levels when outside of Metamorphosis. Here are some potential new 3rd level abilities (in addition to Torment) to help make up for the loss:

**Soul Cleave (Version 1)**
When you use Demon's Bite, you can spend an extra fel point to transform it into a soul cleave attack. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt with your weapon attacks this turn. These hit points last until your next short or long rest.

**Soul Cleave (Version 2)**
You can spend 2 fel points as an action to perform a slicing attack biting into your opponent's souls. Make a single melee attack roll against all creatures within reach. If the attack hits, the targets take damage as if they were hit by your melee attack plus an additional 1d8 (force? psychic?) damage. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt. These hit points last until your next short or long rest.

**Thick Skin**
While you are wearing light or no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC increases by 2, to a maximum of 20. (21?)
