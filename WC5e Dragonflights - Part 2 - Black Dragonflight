### Black Dragonflight
*"My blessing upon you will seem humble compared to those which have been bestowed upon the others: the managing of time, of life, of dreams and magic. I offer you the earth. The soil, the ground, the deep places. But know that the earth is the basis of all things. It is where we are rooted. Where you must come from, if you are to go to. Here is whence true strength comes. From deep places... within the world, and within oneself."*

<div style="text-align:right">

*— Khaz'goroth's blessing of the Black Aspect*

</div>

<div style='margin-top:20px;'></div>

<div style="text-align:justify">

*"Silence! If you insist on calling it a gift, so be it. Know then what it is to be me, to be given this gracious gift... to feel the fiery heart of this world as your own. Know what it is to feel the weight of this dying world on your shoulders. Does the gift taste as sweet as you thought it would? This is what the other Aspects wish: to chain you to this world as I have been. To damn you to a life of eternal torment."*

</div>

*— The Black Aspect, Deathwing*

<div style='margin-top:20px;'></div>

Black scales, the deepest colors of onyx and ebony; eyes that burn red with the flame within, and a similar crimson glow visible deep within their throat when they give a mighty roar; black dragons are a sight to behold. Charged with the protection of the earth, and bearers of its strength, the black dragonflight is one of great power.

***Defenders of Azeroth.*** For a time, black dragons were once defenders of Azeroth. They shaped the lands, created mountains and valleys, and represented the strength of the earth. For millennia they defended Azeroth from destruction, until they fell from grace.

***Corrupted Champions.*** At an unknown point, whisperings of the Old Gods corrupted the black dragons, especially their Aspect and leader, Neltharion. During the War of the Ancients, Neltharion was instrumental in the creation of the Dragon Soul; this was ostensibly to defeat the Burning Legion, but Neltharion used it to betray his allies.

With the Legion all but defeated, Neltharion turned the Dragon Soul on the night elves and dragons who had been his allies. Only the timely arrival of Korialstrasz, consort of the red dragonqueen, saved them all from certain death.

***Enemies of Azeroth.*** The betrayal was so great that the other dragonflights never truly recovered, and the ensuing war between dragons further damaged the species. Black dragons were hunted down and nearly annihilated, their numbers reduced to very few. From that point forward they served as infrequent but deadly threats to all.

During much of this time, Neltharion — now called Deathwing — was rarely seen. After a series of setbacks and a defeat at the hands of the other Aspects, he retreated to Deepholm in the Elemental Plane. Many thought he was defeated forever, but they were very wrong.

***Cataclysmic Threat.*** After the fall of the Lich King, Deathwing made his return. He fractured the World Pillar, which caused the Cataclysm and reshaped much of the surface of Azeroth. He and the black dragonflight brought the world to its knees, but were ultimately defeated by brave heroes. At their side fought Wrathion, an uncorrupted black dragonwhelp who represented hope for the future.

<br/>    60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a 
<br/>    DC 19 Strength saving throw or take 17 (5d6) 
<br/>    necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns and 
<br/>    have disadvantage on Strength-based attack rolls,

<br/>    turns, ending the effects on itself on a success.

>
> ### Legendary Actions
> The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
>
> **Compel.** Target creature within 120 feet the dragon can 
<br/>    see must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw 
<br/>    or, on its next turn, it must take the Dash action to 
<br/>    move toward the dragon.
> <br/> **Wrack.** Target creature within 120 feet the dragon can 
<br/>    see must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw 
<br/>    or have disadvantage on Strength-based attack rolls, 
<br/>    checks, and saving throws for 1 minute. A creature 
<br/>    can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
<br/>    turns, ending the effects on itself on a success.
> <br/> **Terrifying Roar (Costs 2 Actions).** Each creature in a 
<br/>    60-foot cone must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving 
<br/>    throw or become frightened of the dragon until the 
<br/>    end of its next turn.
> <br/> **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its 
<br/>    wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon 
<br/>    must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or

> ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The wyrm's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 22, +14 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
> 
> At will: *charm person*, *detect thoughts*, *earth <br/>     tremor* ^XGE^, *gust* ^XGE^, *mold earth* ^XGE^, *resistance*
> <br/> 3/day each: *erupting earth* ^XGE^, *suggestion*, *wall of <br/>     stone*
> <br/> 1/day each: ✦ *cataclysm*, *earthquake*, *move earth*
> 
> ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the wyrm fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
>
> ***Protector of Earth.*** The wyrm can use its tremorsense while it is flying within 120 feet of the ground as if it was on the ground.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The wyrm can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claw.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (2d10 + 9) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) fire damage.
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (2d6 + 9) slashing damage.
>
> ***Tail Sweep.*** The wyrm swings its tail, and every creature within 20 feet of it must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 18 (2d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone. 
>
> ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the wyrm's choice that is within 120 feet of the wyrm and aware of it must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the wyrm's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
>
> \columnbreak
>
> ***Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6).*** The wyrm uses one of the following breath weapons.
>
> **Lava Breath.** The wyrm exhales a massive jet of lava in a 
<br/>    90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a 
<br/>    DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 82 (15d10) 
<br/>    fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage 
<br/>    on a successful one.
> <br/> In addition, the area hit by the lava becomes difficult 
<br/>    terrain for 1 minute. When a creature enters the area 
<br/>    for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there,
<br/>    they take 18 (4d8) fire damage. 
> <br/> **Shadow Breath.** The wyrm exhales shadowy fire in a 
<br/>    90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a 
<br/>    DC 23 Strength saving throw or take 31 (9d6) 
<br/>    necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns and 
<br/>    have disadvantage on Strength-based attack rolls, 
<br/>    checks, and saving throws for 1 minute. A creature 
<br/>    can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
<br/>    turns, ending the effects on itself on a success.
>
> ***Change Shape.*** The wyrm magically transforms into any humanoid that is Medium or Small, while retaining its game statistics (other than its size). This transformation ends if the dragon is reduced to 0 hit points or uses a bonus action to end it.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Lava Spout.*** Whenever the wyrm is damaged by a creature within 30 feet of it, it can cause a vent of flame to erupt beneath the attacker. The creature must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
>
> ### Legendary Actions
> The wyrm can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The wyrm regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
>
> **Compel.** Target creature within 120 feet the wyrm can 
<br/>    see must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw 
<br/>    or, on its next turn, it must take the Dash action to 
<br/>    move toward the wyrm.
> <br/> **Wrack.** Target creature within 120 feet the wyrm can 
<br/>    see must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw 
<br/>    or have disadvantage on Strength-based attack rolls, 
<br/>    checks, and saving throws for 1 minute. A creature 
<br/>    can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
<br/>    turns, ending the effects on itself on a success.
> <br/> **Terrifying Roar (Costs 2 Actions).** Each creature in a 
<br/>    90-foot cone must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving 
<br/>    throw or become frightened of the wyrm until the 
<br/>    end of its next turn.
> <br/> **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The wyrm beats its 
<br/>    wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the wyrm 
<br/>    must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or 
<br/>    take 16 (2d6 + 9) bludgeoning damage and be 
<br/>    knocked prone. The wyrm can then fly up to half its 
<br/>    flying speed.
> <br/> **Breath Weapon (Costs 3 Actions).** The wyrm uses its 
<br/>    breath weapon, if it is available.

### Black Dragon Lairs
Black dragons lair in caves and caverns near volcanic activity, such as hot springs or magma veins. 

[Obsidian Dragonshrine, volcanoes.]

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
- Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If any of the effect's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.
- The dragon causes up to six corpses within the lair to rise as skeletons, zombies, or ghouls. These undead obey its telepathic commands, which can reach anywhere in the lair. 
- Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads a round corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.

#### Regional Effects
The region containing a legendary black dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
- Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted by sulfur.
- Magma rises close to the surface, often spilling out of cracks in a 1 mile radius of the lair.
- Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.
