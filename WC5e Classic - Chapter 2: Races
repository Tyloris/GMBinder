### Dwarf Traits
Your dwarf character has the following racial traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score <br> increases by 2.

***Age.*** Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they're considered young until they reach the age of 40. On average, they live about 320 years.

***Alignment.*** Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that all deserve to share in the benefits of a just order.

***Creature Type.*** You are a Humanoid.

***Size.*** Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium. To set your height and weight randomly, start with rolling the size modifier:
<div style="margin-top: -18px; font-family: ScalySans, sans-serif">

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Size Modifier:*** 2d4
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Height:*** 3 feet + 8 inches + your size modifier in inches
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Weight in Pounds:*** 120 + (2d6 x your size modifier)
</div>

<div style='margin-top:-3px;'></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.

***Earthen Heritage.*** Whenever you make an ability check involving metal or stone objects and structures, you can roll a d4 and add it to the total. This does not help you divine the function of magical or technological devices, but may help you determine what metal an axe is made from.

***Dwarven Hardiness.*** You have advantage on Constitution ability checks and saving throws made against nonmagical hazards and effects, such as extreme hot and cold, a forced march on no sleep, or downing several gallons of ale.

***Sure-Footed.*** You have advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws to avoid being forcibly moved (such as through a bull rush) or knocked prone, so long as your feet are firmly planted on the ground (not when you are climbing, riding, flying, etc.).

\pagebreak

## Forsaken
Ichor of undeath

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2 and your Constitution score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Forsaken are preserved in whatever state they were raised and thus do not age. However, decay and rot can cause their body to degrade if they do not perform upkeep, and the chill of undeath can affect the mind's sanity, leading to similar issues as a mortal's advancing age.

***Alignment.*** Forsaken typically lack the empathy required to be good and thus tend towards evil or at best neutrality.

***Creature Type.*** You are Undead. This causes a number of game effects to affect you differently, as seen in the Undead Players sidebar.

***Size.*** You are Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Undead Fortitude.*** When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead, unless the damage is radiant. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

***Undead Nature.*** As an undead, you have the following properties:
- You are immune to poison damage, disease, and the poisoned condition.
- You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe, though you can choose to do so.
- You do not need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep. Instead, you fill your short and long rests with light activity to gain their benefits.
- You cannot benefit from certain spells, such as *cure wounds*, and you are immune to other spells such as *crown of madness* or *dominate person* as they specifically target humanoids. See the **Spells By Affected Creature Type** sidebar in Chapter ?: Spells.

Painful Light. Incapacited by radiant damage and healing magic.


False Appearance. You may, as an action, collapse your form into a pile of bones. While you remain motionless, you are indistinguishable from a normal pile of bones. In this state, you are prone and your speed is 0.



However certain spells have no effect on you, namely healing spells like cure wounds or healing word, as well as other spells that specify that they have no effect on Constructs or Undead.


Carrion Eater. You gain nutrition from corpses, ignoring any detriment. You may consume dead or rotting bodies and flesh to fulfill your food requirement, and you are immune to any diseases or effects that would render you poisoned when you do so.


Undead Fortitude. If damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + half the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point instead. You regain usage of this feat after a short rest.

SUBTYPES: Fresh Raise (Appear almost normal), Decaying (Normal), Mummified, Skeletal (False Appearance as a skeleton, disadv on Str)

> ##### Undead Players


Cannibalism. Using 1 minute, you can cannibalize the corpse of a humanoid that has been dead for less than 1 hour. When done, you regain a number of hit point sequal to your level + your Constitution modifier. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.

Shadow Resistance. You have resistance to necrotic damage.

Undead. You have two creature types: humanoid and undead. You can be affected by a game effect if it works on either of your creature types. In addition, you gain the following benefits:

Will of the Forsaken. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened as well as effects that turn undead. Additionally, magic can't put you to sleep.

## Orc

https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Red_Orc_(5e_Race_Variant)
### Orc Traits
***Ability Score Increase.*** Your XX score increases by 2.

***Age.***

***Alignment.***

***Creature Type.***

***Size.***

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Blood Rage.*** 

When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can choose to not fall unconscious and enter a blood rage instead. When you enter your blood rage, you lose concentration on any powers you are maintaining.

The blood rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you regain hit points or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature or taken damage since the end of your last turn.

For the duration, you are immune to being charmed or frightened and the only Action you may take is either Attack or Dash. You continue to make death saving throws as normal and damage causes death saving throw failures. However, no amount of success or failures cause you to stabilize or die until blood rage ends. Additionally, when you would receive a death saving throw success you may, instead, remove a death saving throw failure, or vice versa.

When blood rage ends, if you have four or more death saving throw failures, you die. Otherwise, you fall unconscious.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.



Whenever you have less than half your hit points remaining and suffer damage to your hit points, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or enter a blind rage, immediately losing concentration on any powers you are maintaining. You must also make the saving throw whenever you choose to enter your blood rage.

While in a blind rage, you must use your action and any potential bonus actions or reactions each round to attack the creature nearest to you. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after you kill your current target. If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random.

You are in a blind range until you die, are incapacitated, or start your turn with no creatures within 24 meters of you that you can see or hear.

Capped Strength

***Goring Rush.*** Immediately after you use the Dash action on your turn and move at least 20 feet, you can make one melee attack with your horns as a bonus action.

> 5th Edition was built under the assumption that player characters would be exclusively be playing Medium or Small races. Choosing to play a race that is Large size comes with both pros and cons, allowing you to 
> 
> ***Areas of Effect.*** 
>
> ***Carrying Capacity.*** You have double the carrying capacity (PHB p. 176).
>
> ***Consumables.*** You require four times as much food and water per day (DMG p. 111).
>
> ***Cover.*** It should be harder for a Large creature to find cover (PHB p. 196). The DM will adjudicate this, but roughly speaking where a Medium creature would find total cover, a Large creature might only receive three-quarters cover; where a Medium creature finds three-quarters cover, a Large creature might only receive half cover; and where a Medium creature finds half cover, a Large creature might find none.
>
> ***Equipment.*** Armor, clothing, and other items made for your size costs four times as much as the equivalent made for Medium sized creatures and weighs twice as much. Large containers such as backpacks also have four times the carrying capacity. You can ignore the increased costs when determining starting equipment, and most magic items will resize to fit you character.
>
> ***Reach.*** 
>
> ***Unarmed Strikes.*** You deal 1d4 + your Strength modifier damage with unarmed strikes.
> 
> ***Weapons.*** Large-sized creatures can use Large-sized weapons (DMG p. 278). However, this rule was intended for determining the threat of monster opponents, not player characters. Instead use the variant rule for Oversized weapons (page ###). When using Medium-sized weapons, use the following rules for weapon properties: 
> - You struggle with Light weapons and have disadvantage on attack rolls with them.
> - One handed weapons without the Versatile trait are treated as Light weapons for the purposes of qualifying for two-weapon fighting.
> - Weapons with the Versatile trait deal the damage given in parenthesis even if wielded in only one hand.
