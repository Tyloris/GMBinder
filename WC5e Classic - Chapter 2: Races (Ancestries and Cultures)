# Character Origins
This chapter describes the three components of an adventurer's origin: ancestry, culture, and background. Together, these elements suggest your character's early experience and family origin before taking up the adventuring life and learning the capabilities of a class (described in chapter ###).

## Origin Components
Each part of your character's origin reflects facets of your character, their life, and the circumstances that started them on the path to adventure.

Each component reflects a part of your character's life: the race or species that they were born as, the culture that shaped them into the person they grew up to be, and the position they held within that society that taught them the skills they needed to succeed.

As no two people are the same, neither are any two origins. You can choose freely from each list of Ancestry, Culture, and Background. Examples include a "traditional" origin such as Arthas Menethil, a Human from the human kingdom of Lordaeron, where he is known as a Noble prince. Or alternatively, an unusual origin such Thrall, an Orc raised among the Lordaeron culture as a Gladiator.

### Choosing your Ancestry
When you choose your character's ancestry, you determine whether your character is a human or a member of a fantastical species, such as an elf, orc, or gnome.

An ancestry determines many of the physiological aspects of your character. For example, orcs are naturally muscle-bound creatures, elves and draenei have an inherent talent for magic, and tauren are immense cow-like creatures with wide horns. These attributes provide certain benefits shared with all others of their species. 

#### Parts of an Ancestry
An ancestry includes the following parts.

***Age.*** Members of most species live for about 80 years, with exceptions noted in the text about the species in this chapter. Regardless of life span, members of all species reach physical maturity at about the same age. Your character can be any age that isn't beyond their species' normal life span.

***Creature Type.*** A character's ancestry determines the character's creature type, which is described in the Rules Glossary. Most species in this chapter are Humanoid.

***Size.*** Your character’s ancestry determines the character's size. Individuals within an ancestry cover a wide range of heights, and some species include such diversity of size that you can choose whether your character is Small or Medium.

***Speed.*** Your character’s ancestry determines the character’s Speed.

***Special Traits.*** Each ancestry gives a character special traits - unique characteristics based on the ancestry's physiology or magical nature. When you choose an ancestry, your character gets all the special traits listed for it. Some traits involve making a choice from a handful of options.

### Choosing your Culture
A character’s culture is often determined by regional or social norms. Things like the languages you speak, the knowledge you value, or the habits you’ve developed are often part of your cultural upbringing. A character with Dalaran culture might put a lot of value in studying history or magic and would take pride in their ability to speak many languages. Your culture gives your character Cultural Traits, which are typically learned skills and talents.

#### Parts of a Culture
A culture includes some special traits, determined by the upbringing that primarily shaped your character. When you choose a culture, your character gets all the special traits listed for it. Some traits involve making a choice from a handful of options.

### Subancestries and Subcultures
Some Heritages have subancestries, such as Trolls or Elves, who have been known to have members with significantly different physiology. Heritages can also have Subcultures, areas where these groups of people have differing or specific beliefs or values from their larger culture.

### Character Backgrounds
Your character's background is a collection of characteristics that represent the place and occupation that were most formative before your character embarked on a life of adventure.

Each background includes a brief narrative of what your character’s past might have been like. Alter the details of this narrative however you like.

#### Parts of a Background
A background includes the following parts.

***Ability Scores.*** A background lists three of your character’s ability scores. Increase one by 2 and another one by 1, or increase all three by 1. None of these increases can raise a score above 20.

***Feat.*** A background gives your character a specified Origin feat (described in chapter 5).

***Skill Proficiencies.*** A background gives your character proficiency in two specified skills.

***Tool Proficiency.*** Each background gives a character proficiency with one tool—either a specific tool or one chosen from the Artisan’s Tools category.

***Equipment.*** Each background offers a choice between a package of equipment and 50 GP.

## Dwarf
### Ancestral Traits
Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven biology.

***Age.*** Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.

***Size.*** Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Low-Light Vision.*** Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light.

***Dwarven Resilience.*** Dwarves are known for their hearty constitution, equally at home on frigid mountaintops as in sweltering forges or jungles. 
- Whenever you make a Constitution ability check or saving throw, you may roll a d4 and add it to the total **[1]**. 
- Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level, due in large part to the long history of difficult labor required to survive underground for generations.
- Your speed isn’t reduced by wearing heavy armor.

Expert Tools. You have proficiency with one set of tools of your choice. If you choose a set of artisan’s tools, when you make an ability check involving those artisan’s tools, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check.

Suspicious of Magic. You have advantage on saving throws against illusions and against being charmed or paralyzed.

### Cutural Traits
There are three main subcultures, called clans, among the dwarves: the Bronzebeards, Dark Irons, and Wildhammers, each of which has a smattering of lesser families following them. Named after th founding clans, they

***Dwarven Bravery.*** Practically every dwarf has a tendency towards being either brave or stubborn, oftentimes both. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

#### Bronzebeard
If there's one thing these dwarves love, it's drinking. And fighting. Two things.

***Alignment.*** Bronzebeard society is steeped in tradition, with a strong connection to their clan. They tend towards being lawful.

***Dwarven Combat Training.*** Bronzebeards have a strong martial tradition, which helped their rise to prominence during the War of the Three Hammers. You have proficiency in light and medium armor, as well as the battleaxe, rifle, and warhammer.

What’s more, you have developed an innate sense for whether you are descending, ascending, or traveling in a straight line when moving through such tunnels.

Ash and Flame. The ancestors of ash dwarves lived within volcanically active caves, deep underground. There breathable air was scarce and often toxic. You have resistance to fire damage and can breathe normally in thick smoke and clouds of ash. Furthermore, you have resistance to poison damage from gasses or toxin clouds of all kinds.
Safe in Shadow. You have advantage on Stealth checks. You lose this ability in areas of bright light.

- Ice Block. As a reaction when you take damage, you can freeze yourself in a block of ice for up to 1 minute. While frozen in this way you are petrified, and gain an amount of temporary hit points equal to five times your level. You are aware of your surroundings while in this state, and can choose to unfreeze yourself at the start of any of your turns within the next minute.

In addition, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra cold damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra cold damage equals your level.

Their kingdom rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and roaring forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, these common threads unite all dwarves. Within the mountains of Khaz Modan, they continue their ancient ways, extending the depth of their halls, and con-structing marvels of architecture,

### A Reclaimed Legacy
The undiscovered fragments of their past 
<br>have led the dwarves on an unprecedented 
<br>exodus of exploration to seek out their 
<br>origins. Seeking out their origins, the 
<br>dwarves have dispatched prospectors 
<br>across all of Lordaeron in order to seek out 
<br>signs of the Titans, the supposed creators of the 
<br>dwarves. The dwarves have embraced the idea that it is their purpose to search the world for more signs of proof of their heritage. Dwarven outposts exist in the most desolate of places on Azeroth. 

Here, the dwarves spend their time seeking out the secrets of ancient times, or simply use their outposts as staging grounds for expeditions to clear out their enemies so that they may continue their quest.

### Short and Stout
Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.

Dwarves skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. With their dark iron kin having notably darker skin of gray to coal-black. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though wildhammer dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.

### Affiliation
Dwarves are members of the Alliance and staunch allies of its human founders, having fought side-by-side with their armies in more than one war. Although the night elves may share the same allegiances, most dwarves looks at "pointy eared humans" with suspicion and trepidation, preferring to keep them at an arm's distance.

***Ironforge Dwarves.*** These dwarves have been part of the Alliance since its founding in Lordaeron and continue to be a steadfast ally to its cause. 

***Wildhammer Dwarves.*** These dwarves never pledged their allegiance to the Alliance and have instead put their trust in their ironforge kin. They remain an isolated clan of dwarves that choose their own battles, but are often found among ironforge soldiers.

***Dark Iron Dwarves.*** These dwarves fought against the Alliance for many years as they served the deceased Fire&shy;lord Ragnaros. His death split the united clan and forced them to find new allies, many proclaimed Moira their new queen and have since joined the Alliance. However, there are still many who distrust the cunning dark iron dwarves and their pledged allegiance to the Alliance is newfound.
