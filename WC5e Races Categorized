# Chapter 1: Races
Armies and factions have always defined the Warcraft world, and two of the most powerful factions on Azeroth today are the Alliance and Horde. Most players belong to one faction or the other, although anomalies do exist.

## Choosing a Side
At character creation, every player must choose their character’s faction. It is as much a part of the hero as their class or background. All characters in a party are usually of the same faction.

Although every race has an affiliation, there are excep&shy;tions. Creating a character outside their normal affiliation is challenging, but offers a great roleplay opportunities for the player. Some suggestions are listed below.

 - The character was born into the faction.
 - The character was saved or befriended by <br> members of the faction.
 - The character fled from their faction.
 - The character witnessed members of their faction <br> doing something they found reprehensible.

### The Alliance
The Alliance have proven themselves to be fierce comba&shy;tants, often giving their lives when called for. The faction is not a uniform governmental body, but is a coalition of mutual military and economic aid. Diplomacy is key within the Alliance and decisions are traditionally made by being voted on by the Alliance's most influential members. Storm&shy;wind is described as the most powerful force in the now multiracial Alliance. With it becoming the de facto leader of the remaining human kingdoms and entering a powerful alliance with the strongest dwarven kingdom, Ironforge, Stormwind has thus been shown to be the most influential kingdom and therefore the de facto driving force of Alliance politics. Therefore, Stormwind is undisputedly looked to for maintaining the Alliance and its policies. Stormwind is where the main superpowers of the Alliance conference to discuss world issues and mutual defense. The majority of Alliance citizens also recognize Stormwind City as the heart of the Alliance. The High King coordinates the workings of the Alliance's armies in order to safeguard the Alliance's interests and defense. 

Even now, as always, humans are the glue that hold the Alliance together, being the most numerous and diplomatic of the member races. The armies of Stormwind are primarily stationed in the southern Eastern Kingdoms, securing regions such as Elwynn Forest, Duskwood, Westfall, and the Redridge Mountains, as well as having outposts and bases stationed at key points in Lordaeron, Northrend, and Kalimdor. The armies of Ironforge are mainly stationed in Khaz Modan along with their gnome allies, and the night elven armies are mainly defending 
<br> <span style="margin-left:30px"></span> northern Kalimdor from the Horde's deforestation 
<br> <span style="margin-left:75px"></span> of Ashenvale. The remaining draenei forces 
<br> <span style="margin-left:85px"></span> are still trying to secure their new home on
<br> <span style="margin-left:90px"></span> Azuremyst Isle, and are also stationed in
<br> <span style="margin-left:105px"></span> Outland. The recently brought in
<br> <span style="margin-left:110px"></span> Gilnean armies are defending them-
<br> <span style="margin-left:120px"></span> selves from the endless Forsaken.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:233px;'></div>

### The Horde 
The Horde makes no compromises when it comes to excellence, and the power and ferocity of their warriors is legendary. Misunderstood by many as evil, the Horde possesses a strong code of honor and strict laws for disobedience. All members of the Horde have to swear a blood oath to join  the faction and are thus obligated to follow the warchief's commands and support the warchief in war if the warchief calls upon them for aid. The position of warchief can be attained by having the previous warchief choose a succes&shy;sor or challenging the current warchief to a Mak'gora: a prearranged duel with deadly weapons between two people following a formal procedure in the presence of witnesses and traditionally fought until one party yields or is killed, usually to settle a quarrel involving a point of honor. Above all else, the title warchief is granted to those who display strength and decisive action.

The warchief may accept ambassadors and advisors from all the different tribes and members of the Horde to makes sure their voice is heard in the running of the fledg&shy;ling hegemony but ultimately, only the warchief may have the final say in matters concerning the entire Horde. Each race within the Horde choose a single leader to govern their people and their people's kingdoms and also to repre&shy;sent their people in the high Horde echelon.

Despite their somewhat monstrous appearance, the majority of the Horde is not evil, much like the Alliance, it is comprised of diverse factions and individuals who possess a wide range of values and virtues. Even so, there is one expectation that must be met when joining the Horde: regardless of gender or station, all are expected to pull their own weight and give their talents for the betterment of the Horde. When weakness is a liability to the of the Horde, it is the duty of the strong to usurp control from the incom&shy;petent and redeem the Horde. 

*Lok'tar ogar! Victory or death*—These words bind one to the Horde. For they are the most sacred and fundamental of truths to any warrior of the Horde, for the Horde, failure is not an option.

Culturally, orcs and tauren believe in redemption more than most other races on Azeroth and are willing to give almost anyone a chance, regardless of reputation. The trolls seem to have even accepted, (if not at least 
<br>olerate) their ancient enemy the blood elves.
<br>Largely because of these beliefs, a number 
<br>of mortal races and many diverse factions 
<br>can be found in service to the Horde.

## Choosing a Race
Not every intelligent race of the multiverse is appropriate for a player-controlled adventurer. The ones presented in this book are the races most well known to become adven&shy;turers and heroes, spread throughout every corner of Azeroth's continents.

Your choice of race affects many different aspects of your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that exist throughout your character's adventuring career. When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of character you want to play. For example, a gnome could be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a dwarf makes a tough warrior, and an elf can be a master of arcane magic.

Your character race not only affects your ability scores and traits but also provides the cues for building your character's story. Each race's description in this chapter includes information to help you roleplay a character of that race, including personality, physical appearance, features of society, and racial alignment tendencies.

These details are suggestions to help you think about your character; adventurers can deviate widely from the norm for their race. It's worthwhile to consider why your character is different, as a helpful way to think about your character's background and personality.

### Racial Traits
The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following entries appear among the traits of most races.

#### Ability Score Increase
Every race increases one or more of a character's
ability scores.

#### Age
The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race's expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game.

#### Alignment
Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character.

#### Size
Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons.

#### Speed
Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling and fighting.

#### Languages
By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages. Each race has their own language, with multiple dialects. as well as a 'common' language, that the majority of their faction speaks and understands. Chapter 4 lists languages commonly spoken on Azeroth.

\columnbreak

#### Subraces
Many races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships among the subraces vary significantly from race to race.

### Languages
Dozens of languages can be heard across Azeroth, and every tongue has dialects and regional variants. In order for its races to communicate intelligibly, the Common tongue is essential. But other languages remain widely used in homes and within the borders of certain regions.

##### Standard Languages

## Human
*No one feels he deserves it. Because no one does. It's grace, pure and simple, we are inherently unworthy, simply because we're human. Aye the elves, dwarves, and all the other races are flawed. But the Light loves us anyway. It loves us for what we sometimes can rise to in rare moments. It loves us for what we can do to help others.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Uther the Lightbringer* &nbsp;</div>
<div style='margin-top:-5px'></div>

Human kingdoms have existed for thousand of years, and humans themselves for thousands more. Their short lives in comparison to dwarves and elves pushes them to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Their valor, optimism, and stubbornness have led them to build some of the greatest kingdoms on Azeroth, some of which still stand a millennium later. Whatever have pushed them down, it has only strengthened the bond between those that still stand.

### A Broad Spectrum
With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically diverse than any other race. There is no typical human. An individual can stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely live even a single century.

\columnbreak

<br>
<div style='margin-top:448px'></div>

### Variety in All Things
Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among Azeroth's races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different kingdoms where they have settled. When they settle though, they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries. They live fully in the present but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy.

### Proudly Standing
Despite what atrocities have happened to them, humans remain hardy and brave, thoroughly committed to building strong societies, reinforcing their kingdoms, and reclaiming lost nations. Years of war have tempered their resolve, and they are more determined than ever before. Their value of virtue, honor and courage shine their ranks.

### Faithful
Among all human nations, the holy light is a central part of civilized society. By most it is considered the only religion and a staple of worship, respect, and honor. The religion is widely worshiped throughout Azeroth, yet humans were the first to utilize its powers in an offensive manner with the creation of paladins. Throughout their kingdoms, churches of the holy light can be found, an organization dedicated to creating a world of honor, and justice.

### Affiliation
Humans began the Alliance and it could not exist without them. Humans and orcs joined forces to face the Burning Legion years ago, but old habits returned once they dispatched the demon threat. Although the Alliance and Horde leaders bear a healthy respect for each another, old racial hatreds still stir within the hearts of their troops. 

They respect the races of their alliance, and carries no ill wish against any of them. They know they are the center stone of the alliance, and that a good relationship is key.

### Human Names and Ethnicities
Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans as a whole have no typical names. Some human parents give their children names from other languages, such as Dwarven or Darnassian, but most parents give names that are linked to their region's culture or to the naming traditions of their ancestors.

The material culture and physical characteristics of humans can change wildly from region to region. For example, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature are different in the peninsula of Gilneas than in the southern kingdom of Stormwind. Human physical characteristics, though, vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of the Eastern Kingdoms have every possible variation of coloration and features.

Seven human kingdoms and ethnic groups are widely recognized. These groups, and the typical names of their members, can be used as inspiration no matter which kingdom your human is in.

Their kingdom rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and roaring forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, these common threads unite all dwarves. Within the mountains of Khaz Modan, they continue their ancient ways, extending the depth of their halls, and con-structing marvels of architecture,

### A Reclaimed Legacy
The undiscovered fragments of their past 
<br>have led the dwarves on an unprecedented 
<br>exodus of exploration to seek out their 
<br>origins. Seeking out their origins, the 
<br>dwarves have dispatched prospectors 
<br>across all of Lordaeron in order to seek out 
<br>signs of the Titans, the supposed creators of the 
<br>dwarves. The dwarves have embraced the idea that 
<br>it is their purpose to search the world for more signs of proof of their heritage. Dwarven outposts exist in the most desolate of places on Azeroth. 

Here, the dwarves spend their time seeking out the secrets of ancient times, or simply use their outposts as staging grounds for expeditions to clear out their enemies so that they may continue their quest.

### Short and Stout
Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.

Dwarves skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. With their Dark Iron kin having notably darker skin of gray to coal-black. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though wildhammer dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.

<div style='margin-top:695px;'></div>

### Innovative
Dwarves are a proud, stern and determined people with streaks of kindness hidden under the gruff exteriors of their sturdy frames. Their love for battle, invention and exploration impels them ever forward to discover and unearth the mysteries of their heritage, educating them further about those who first created the dwarven race.

Still, they keep to the forges and workshops, ever inno-vating and creating new and more effective ways of warfare. Steam powered technology and firearms originate from dwarven inventiveness and creativity. The stout race is renowned for its skills at battle and also as cunning engineers and crafters. 

### Affiliation
Dwarves are members of the Alliance and staunch allies of its human founders, having fought side-by-side with their armies in more than one war. Although the night elves may share the same allegiances, most dwarves looks at "pointy eared humans" with suspicion and trepidation, preferring to keep them at an arm's distance.

## Night Elf
*Darkness covered us in the beginning, and we could not see. We cried for guidance and the moon shone down bright upon us. Her soft light not only illuminated the night for us but also gave comfort.
<br>Her light touched us from within, enabling us to see even when the moon was not visible...*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Tyrande Whisperwind* &nbsp;</div>
<div style='margin-top:-5px'></div>

Proud and ancient, the kaldorei once ruled Azeroth as one powerful nation. They were the first to study magic <br>and let it loose throughout the world during the War of the Ancients. Since then most night elves have abandoned arcane, remembering the chaos it brought, turning their attention to raw strength, or the powers of nature.

### Graceful Nature
Imposing in stature, night elves stand as one of the highest race of elves and on Azeroth, with their muscular bodies and slender builds, and long narrow ears. Their skin range in hues of blue, from a light blue sky to the deep blue of the water. With hair varying from a lush green, to blue, to dark purple. It is customary among night elves to paint tattoos across their faces, generally depicting an animal or leaf like design, often done as a rite of passage to adulthood. 

Their eyes shine with a dim golden or silver glow, since the Sundering the golden glow has become ever more common amongst the night elves, a sign of their connection to nature and druidsm. Night elves who's eyes shine silver have left their kins ways for the arcane, and is seen as an outcast by most night elves.

### Belief in the Ancients
Night elves have made close ties to the ancients beings of Azeroth. They have a strong connection to the goddess Elune and have built temples and organizations in her name to carry on her message. The sisters of Elune have long since been the leaders of the night elven military, and official head of their civilization as a whole.

Although Elune stands above all else, the night elves also carry a deep respect and gratitude to the ancient guardians of Azeroth, also know as wild gods, many of whom have not been seen since the blessing of Nordrassil. Was it not for their aid during the War of the Ancients, the night elves would have perished from the surface of Azeroth.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:570px;'></div>

### A Timeless Perspective
Night Elves can live to become thousands of years of age, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived races more deeply. They are often more amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, whether adven-turing on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them.

Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compro-mise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, strategy, and the foces of nature.

### Affiliation
Night elves are members of the Alliance, they pledged their allegiance after the Reign of Chaos, a long fought war that would have dire consequences for the elves and their homeland. Although all members of the Alliance are against the orcs and their Horde, few harbour as much hatred for the orcs as the night elves. They blame the green-skinned brutes for the destruction of their forests and the taint of fel that now protrudes through the Felwoods.

#### An Ancient Hatred
Many night elves still remember the atrocities brought upon their kin by the highborne elves during the War of the Ancient and show a weariness towards arcane magic and its users. They look down upon their ancient brethren, the high elves—also known as blood elves—with disgust and suspicion. However, despite their grudge, they have been able to work together in the past when deemed a necessity for survival.

### Night Elf Names
Night elven names commonly carry a hidden meaning and are often derived from Darnassian words or phrases. Few night elves keep track of family names and surnames are derived from feats done by the night elf's ancestors, it is rare for a night elf to take a new surname as many takes pride in their forefather's achievements.

## Gnome
*You never really understood, did you? 
<br> It is our loyalty to our friends that 
<br> provides our truest, greatest strength... <br> My friends. It is a power that numbers 
<br> cannot match.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Gelbin Mekkatorque*<span style="margin-right:100px"></span></div>
<div style='margin-top:-5px'></div>

Gnomes are a diminutive, wiry race of tinkers who live underground. In the Second War, they built vehicles and gadgets for the Alliance, submarines and flying machines, to combat the Horde. They are great mechanics and inven&shy;tors, and are renowned for their knowledge and eccentric natures. The gnomes had a city, Gnomeregan, built into Ironforge Mountain. But invading troggs destroyed it and slaughtered its citizens.

Many survivors moved into Khaz Modan and now live with the Dun Morogh dwarves, and a few traveled with their dwarven friends to Kalimdor. 

The gnomes are still reeling from the destruction of their home city and are loath to leave the safety of the dwarven tunnels. Most gnomes on Kalimdor remain secluded in Bael Modan.

### Cheerful Expression
Even after the decimation of their race and the destruction of their city, gnomes are an amiable and kind hearted lot. They make and keep friends easily; others find disliking a gnome to be difficult. A gnome's energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch of his or her tiny body. Gnomes average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their bright eyes shine with excitement. Their fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, as if expressing the gnome's insatiable interest in everything around.

A gnome's personality is writ large in his or her appearance. A male gnome's beard, in contrast to his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed but often styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnome's clothing, though usually made in modest earth tones, is elaborately decorated with embroidery, embossing, or gleaming jewels.

### Exceptional Tinkers
Gnomes tend to design complicated devices that are relatively safe. Gnomes are in many ways commensurate organizers: a gnome can spend as much time organizing and planning a project as they do actually working on it. If the design fails, they try to learn why, and fix it if they can. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:545px'></div>

If they meet with success, they will continue to tinker with it and improve the design, often for years afterward. Thus, many gnomish designs feature a high degree of complexity and a low chance of failure, the exceptions being those that dabble with chaos energy — but even then, they take steps to ensure the worst that could happen is a brief, non-fatal failure.

While a goblin would scream and flee at the mere thought of a cost overrun, a gnome simply shrugs and presses on. If a project fails to work correctly the first time, a gnome will continue to tinker with it, while a goblin would usually give up and move to something else. Thus, gnomish items have very low failure rates compared to goblin items.

### Affiliation
Gnomes are members of the Alliance, their shared origin and close proximity to the ironforge dwarves have forged a great friendship between the two races. They battled the Horde during the Second War and bear a grudge towards the orcs, however, their kind and forgiving nature makes them willing to look past old hatred.

They carry little ill or favor towards the races native to Kalimdor, having yet to spend enough time on the continent to form a proper opinion about its denizens.

#### Gnomes and Goblins
Gnomes bear a grudge towards goblins, seeing them not as an enemy, but a rival. It has driven the gnomes into friendly and brutal contests with goblins to determine which of the two races are superior.

### Names
Gnomes are given names at birth and rarely change names throughout their life. Although a gnome is born with the family name of their ancestors, gnomish society expects for each gnome to make accomplishments of their own and many gnomes replace their family name with one of their own that portrays their personal accomplishments.

Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny device (AC 5, 1 HP). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour maintaining it. This can be done as part of a short or long rest), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can maintain a number of devices equal to your proficiency bonus.

When you create a device, choose an effect from the *druidcraft, prestidigitation*, or *thaumaturgy* cantrips (for example, increase the volume of your voice or clean an object). A character can use their Action to activate a device and produce the effect chosen for it.

***Gnomeregan Ingenuity.*** You can add half your proficiency bonus to any Intelligence ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish. Gnomish in many ways look like dwarven, it uses the same script, and is renowned for its technical treatises and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural world.

## Draenei
*In moments of great strife, I gaze into the heavens and <br> see just how far we have already come.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Prophet Velen* &nbsp;</div>
<div style='margin-top:-5px'></div>

Thousands of years ago, the titan Sargeras shattered the tranquility of Argus by offering the eredar immeasurable knowledge and power. The eredar were a knowledge-seeking race and accepted his offer. He bathed them in his fel might, turning them into demonic beings of the burning legion called Man'ari. The prophet Velen got a troubling vision of what his race would become, and fled Argus with his followers by the help of the divine Naaru, who renamed them draenei, or "Exiled Ones" in the common tongue.

The draenei refer to their corrupted brethren as man'ari, meaning "Unnatural Being". Although both originate from the eredar race, neither the draenei or man'ari consider themselves eredars anymore.

### The Divine Naaru
During the draenei's journey, the enigmatic naaru race taught them the ways of the light, though they already had <br> a certain experience with it through Velen and T'uure. The naaru explained that there were other forces in the cosmos that would stand against the Burning Legion.

The naaru bestowed a blessing, the Gift of the Naaru, upon the draenei to signify their new connection the light. Deeply affected by the naaru's words, the draenei vowed to honor the light and uphold the naaru's ideals.

#### Distrust of the Orcs

## Worgen
*When I told you that I wanted to retake Gilneas City from these Forsaken. There were those who said that it was impossible. I say that we no longer let our fears control us! For too long it has controlled me, fear that if all of you knew the whole truth, you would reject me. I give in no longer. Look at me... Now that you know the truth, I ask of you, who will stand with me, who will fight by my side?*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Genn Greymane* &nbsp;</div>
<div style='margin-top:-5px'></div>

worgen are vicious humanoid wolves, a curse thrown upon them by careless druids mingling in powers that were beyond them. The druids turned into the first worgen, feral and uncontrollable, they were sealed away for countless years when night elves realized that their bite was able to transfer the curse to others.

When the forsaken sieged the kingdom of Gilneas, the worgen were released from their imprisonment to fight the undead. The feral worgen were effective, but did not differentiate undead from human. The feral worgen never entered Gilneas, but the humans did. Spreading the curse through the kingdom like wildfire. Realizing their mistake, the night elves came to gilneas rescue to offer their aid, they evacuated as many people as they could, and sailed them to their homeland in Teldrassil. There, night elven druids taught the gilnean people how to control the feral curse that lingered in their veins. Some gilneas were so fascinated by the elves magic and connection to druidism, that they were taught their ways.

### Fierce and Vicious
With their massive shapes of a cross between a human and wolf, and the razor sharp claws, worgen appear like evil of a children's tale to those unaware of their existence. They loom over the heads of humans, ranging well over 6 feet to just under 8 feet. Their furry bodies often make them seem much larger than they are, yet with their massive bodies they weigh between 220 to 310 pounds. Males and females are about the same height and build, with the only distinct difference being a males mane.

Worgen fur varies widely in coloration, with shades of black, gray, and brown being the most common amongst the worgen kin, even if the worgen had light colorations in skin or hair as a human. Worgen eyes vary like humans, from a light blue to a deep brown.

### More than just Ferocious
With their wild appearance it is easy to think of a worgen as a vicious beast. Yet most still carries the properties they had in their human life. The curse will always linger in their blood, giving many worgen's a shorter temper than they might've had before. Yet they carry the same compas-sion and determination as humans do, pushing themselves forward to achieve ever greater things for themselves, their newfound kin and that of the human.

### Affiliation
worgen are members of the Alliance, although the curse of the worgen altered them physically, they are still humans at their core and the founding race of the Alliance. worgen are respectful and trusts the races that have affiliated them&shy;selves with the Alliance. However, the gratitude and respect they carry for night elves is hard to match and without their aid the worgen race would still be feral and hostile to all.

#### Forsaken Hatred
Although no race, Alliance or Horde, trusts or truly likes the forsaken, the gilnean hatred for the undead race goes deeper than most. They have caused much harm to the gil&shy;nean people and lead to the demise of Kingdom of Gilneas, a fact that worgen have and will never forget.

### Worgen Names
Most worgen were Gilnean humans and follow their naming conventions. However, some worgen forgot their past names and lives when the curse turned them feral. These worgen choose a new Gilnean first name and a last name based on feats of strengths done during their cursed worgen life.

## Orc
*To pretend the demonic corruption did not exist is to forget how dreadful the impact was. To make ourselves into victims, rather than claiming our participation in our own destruction. We chose this path, we orcs. We chose it right up until it was too late to turn back. And having made that choice, we can, with the knowledge that we have of the end of that dark and shameful road, choose not to take it.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Warchief Thrall* &nbsp;</div>
<div style='margin-top:-5px'></div>

When the orcs were freed from the Burning Legion, they experienced a spiritual revolution as the unnatural blood&shy;lust left their bodies, connecting them with states of heart and mind that were common to their ancestors. This new generation of orcs for the most part followed Thrall as he forged the Horde through shamanism and tribal traditions.

Though prone to fits of rage in warfare, orcs tend to display a curious feral grace that can rival even the finest fencing of an elven noble. The orcs of today continue to stand in drastic contrast to those that were enslaved by the Burning Legion, who embodied a bestial and diabolical force which was barely being controlled by warlock magic.

### Mindful Individuals
To orcs, prowess in battle bestows great personal honor on an individual. This notion of honor pervades every echelon of orcish culture, and the loss or gain of honor has equal consequence to all orcs regardless of their stature. 

Even the naming of orcs is temporary until they have performed rites of passage; only when orcs bring honor to themselves and thus to their clan do elders grant them adult names based upon their deeds. Orcs may appear quick to anger but they are tempered by the wisdom of <br> the shamans, who are revered across Horde society.

While many in the Alliance still perceive the orcs as brutish or even mindless, they have forged a complex culture embracing many occupations and many different races. No doubt Thrall's leadership aided in bringing this about, yet it is apparent that the Alliance has underesti&shy;mated the orcs' ability to construct a society that is highly influential in world affairs.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:595px;'></div>

### A Spiritual Connection
As far back as orcish history has been recorded, shaman have been mentioned, and learning to speak with the elemental spirits of Draenor was a pivotal achievement in destiny for the orc clans. The first orcs to learn the ways of shamanism hailed from the Shadowmoon clan, but many clans claim the mythical "First Shaman" arose from their ranks, even though the truth is that no one is sure of his or her allegiance.

Several orc shaman worship or at least acknowledge <br> the Earth Mother, the benevolent creator deity primarily worshipped by the tauren.

### Frightful Appearance
Orc males are massive and brutish looking creatures. Weighing in at 250 to 350 pounds and standing from 6 to 7 feet in height, they are not a small race. Even orc women tend to be only a half-foot or so shorter than most males, having broad shoulders and muscular, powerful bodies.

Orcs tend to have bristly hair and beards, often black or brown in color. Their skin ranges from a light green to a dark drab olive. Eyes range in color from a fierce red to a pale blue. Orcs have broad, flat noses, tusk-like teeth jutting from their lower and sometimes upper jaws, and large, pointed ears. They favor clothes of hide, and armor and arm themselves with a variety of gear.

### Affiliation
Orcs are members of the Horde and it would not exist with&shy;out them. They forged the Orcish Horde prior to the First War and the New Horde—also known as the Horde—during the Third War as the orcs made a lasting bond with races native to the continent of Kalimdor. Much of the Horde continues to be influenced by orcish culture and laws.

Although most orcs are members of the Horde, there are those who chose to isolate themselves from its influence and affiliated races. These clans are rarely friendly towards the Horde or its races and some show open hostility.

### Names
Most orcish names derive from words in their language that have some complex meaning or hidden significance to their families. Typically, this is the name of a favorite thing or relative. Family names don’t exist; most orcs have last names related to some great deed of heroism or honor.

## Forsaken
*Death offered no escape for the scores of humans killed during the Lich King’s campaign to scour the living from Lordaeron. Instead, the kingdom’s fallen were risen into undeath as Scourge minions and forced to wage an unholy war against everything. . . and everyone. . . that they once held dear.*
<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

Humans and elves freed from the control of the Lich King who raised them. The forsaken are a strange and dark force, hailing from the twisted, skittering darkness of Undercity, they are nominally allied with the Horde but serve only their own cause.

Under the Lich Kings crusade, the elven Ranger General Sylvanas Windrunner fell in combat. Prince Arthas raised her as a banshee and compelled her to follow his will and command. When the Lich King’s power waned in the inci&shy;dents surrounding the Frozen Throne, Sylvanas harnessed her fury and tore herself free from his skeletal grasp. She freed many other undead as well, and recruited powerful allies from the Burning Legion and the surrounding ogre clans. Sylvanas dubbed her new force the Forsaken, and the undead established their capital in the labyrinthine crypts beneath Lordaeron’s capital city. Their sprawling, subterranean realm now called Undercity.

### A Necessary Alliance
The Forsaken originally became allies of the Horde out of necessity and convenience. They have no love for orcs, tauren or any other living creature, but they need time to strike against the Scourge and allies to help them do it. The Forsaken claim that they joined the Horde to prove their desire to leave their evil ways behind, but no one really believes this. The Horde accepts the forsaken’s help, as they do indeed have a common enemy: the Scourge. The Horde is leery of the forsaken’s tactics, however, and keeps watchful eyes on them.

Though initially the Forsaken alliance with the Horde was one of pure convenience, in recent times it appears that their position in the faction has begun to solidify and many, though not all, of the Forsaken appear to be more or less loyal to the Horde now. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:690px'></div>

### Strange Behaviors
Forsaken culture is strange, a perverse combination of the lives they once knew as mortals and the mindless slavery they experienced in the Scourge, colored by white-hot rage toward the Lich King and an almost equally intense devotion to their queen. 

Some Forsaken attempt to reclaim their humanity by acting in kind and helpful ways. Others allow hatred to fester into cruelty and rage.

### Extreme Alchemists
Never sleeping, eating or falling ill, abandoned by those they once loved, the Forsaken have a brutal set of priorities. 

A great portion of their efforts focus on dark alchemy, and the Royal Apothecary Society commands great power in Undercity’s oily tunnels. The apothecaries constantly send Forsaken on missions to gather odd materials for their twisted experiments. Rumors tell that the undead creatures are working to create a plague that will exterminate the Scourge and every living being on Azeroth.

### Dreadful Looks
Forsaken, unsurprisingly, look like dead people who've been dug up from their graves. Their skin has turned gray and rotting, with bone peeking through the rotted flesh. Their resurrection have given their pupil-less eyes a dim glow of white ghostlight. Most of their muscle have rotted away, giving them a scrawny appearance with jagged move&shy;ments. Their dark resurrection have kept them preserved, but natural decay still proceeds, just at an extremely slow rate compared to normal.

### Affiliation
Forsaken are members of the Horde. Though they do not trust the Horde, nor does most members of the Horde trust them. Their alliance was one of necessity more than desire and the forsaken do their best to help and placate ambassa&shy;dors sent by the Horde. Although some forsaken remember their old life and wishes to be reunited with their family, few families have accepted what has become of their loved ones who've been brought into undeath.

### Names
Forsaken have no naming conventions of their own, most keep the names they were given in life. Forsaken who can't remember their name, or simply desires a new one, often make up a suitable name of their own or pick one they saw on a headstone.

### Forsaken Traits
Your forsaken character has the following racial traits.

***Creature Type.*** You are an Undead. You are also considered a human for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be a human.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2. One other ability scores of your choice increases by 1.

***Age.*** Forsaken do not age, as the undeath ends this process when they are brought back. However, decay and rot can affect the forsaken's mind, and as time goes on they experience issues similar to those of aging.

***Alignment.*** When brought back to undeath, forsaken keep the alignment they had in life. However, most tend to become more chaotic and very few keep a good alignment after decades of being an undead.

***Size.*** Forsaken stand as tall as they did in life and weigh between half as much to as much as they did in life. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

\columnbreak

***Darkvision.*** Born into undeath by unholy magic, you can see normal in dark and dim conditiions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Human Spirit.*** When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die. You must use the new result, even if it is a 1.

***Grave's Rest.*** When you take a long rest, instead of rest&shy;ing, you must spend at least six hours performing light activities to gain the benefits of a Long Rest.

***Skill Versatility.*** You gain proficiency in one skill of <br>your choice.

***Undead Nature.*** You gain the following benefits:
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

- You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.
- You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.
- You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

***Will of the Forsaken.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed and effects that turn undead.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Gutterspeak. Gutterspeak is a lower form of Common used by shady underground markets and rogues' guilds as a tongue of ill-repute.

## Tauren
*Our people have walked this land for many, many years, and in that time have learned much about the world. Our allies will need to look to us for wisdom and guidance. My father once made a promise to the Horde, to repay a debt we owed them for their service to our race. I, for one, intend to deliver on that promise.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— High Chieftain Baine Bloodhoof* &nbsp;</div>
<div style='margin-top:-5px'></div>

The plains of Kalimdor have long been a home to these gargantuan nomads. The tauren are a race of spiritual shamans, hunters, and fighters, who long ago developed a complex culture and system of living without the aid of stonework, steel or conquest. This is not to say that the tauren are a race of pacifists, when they are angered they are capable of retaliating with swift and decisive brutality. 

The tauren are a noble race that embrace the natural world. They have shed their nomadic roots and united in their ancestral lands. Their race may be one of spirituality, reverence for nature, and respect for elders, but it also possesses powerful warriors that willingly fight when the situation demands it. Although strong and capable warriors when roused in battle, most tauren reserve combat for when all other options are exhausted. 

They prefer course of wise discussion and careful rumination before embarking on any great endeavor,
<br> and they have great respect for the wise, spiritual and elderly among their people. The tauren are not wrathful 
<br> by nature, but sometimes a thirst for justice causes them 
<br> to take up arms in anger. 

### Peaceful Race
Tauren have no love for bloodshed, as their deep spiritual beliefs do not have a place for warfare. The elders of a tribe solve most issues, or two tauren might resolve a conflict with a ritual challenge resembling a duel. 

Having become members of the Horde, the introspective race has been involved in more and more conflict, creating a demand for tauren warriors and healers. Many must spend time putting great thought into the actions they perform on the field of battle. Taking another life, whether it is man or beast, is an act filled with great significance and responsibility to the tauren.

### Majestic Appearance
Tauren are large, and muscular with bull-like heads. Males average 10 feet tall and 500 pounds, while females are usually a bit shorter and lighter. Tauren are mostly muscle, having incredibly developed physiques and brawny frames most suitable for combat. Soft, downy fur covers the tauren body, with manes growing along head and neck, the lengths of the arms, and the shins.

Their coloration can range from solid black to blond and even white, to mottled pelts of multiple colors. Although all tauren have horns, they are considerably more prominent on males than females.

### Affiliation
Tauren are members of the Horde. When they first met the orcs after their arrival on Kalimdor, they recognized them as spiritual brethrens for their connection to the elements. Tauren pledged their allegiance to the Horde and see both the orcs and trolls as brothers. Like all, they tolerate the forsaken but never rely or trust them and give blood elves a similar treatment for their taint with magic.

Tauren bear no personal ill will towards the Alliance and view night elves with awe and fear. The two races have co&shy;existed on Kalimdor for centuries and Tauren have long seen the night elves as a mythical race steeped in natural powers and wielders of great magic.

### Names 
The language of the tauren is often harsh and low sounding, which is reflected in the names of their children. The last name of a tauren is usually a family name, handed down through the generations. If the tauren has performed some act that has made an impression on the elders of his tribe, however, he may choose to take on his own last name to commemorate that act.

<div style='margin-top:-18px;'></div>

Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes 1d12 bludgeoning damage and falls prone. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and no other effect. This damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).

You can use your War Stomp a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Taur-ahe. Taur-ahe is a harsh, and low sounding language, without a proper alphabet, their written language is made of elaborate pictograms and pictoforms.

## Troll
*Your ancestry dates back to the dawn of the world. Great were the ancient empires of the trolls. I see a spark in your eyes, a powerful will - you wish to be great again, yes?* 
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Lorewalker Cho* &nbsp;</div>

The jungle trolls are sometimes referred to as Gurubashi trolls, after the ancient empire of the same name. Their capital, Zul'Gurub, is located in Stranglethorn Vale, along with many smaller towns, cities, and villages, many of which are in a state of ruin or disrepair. The largest jungle troll settlement outside Stranglethorn is Sen'jin Village founded by the Darkspear tribe, who had been displaced from their exile on the Broken Isles and Echo Isles.

Forest trolls hold all other races in contempt — especially blood elves, whom they consider the despoilers of their ancient homeland. They will only work with others if it means the elimination of an even more hated enemy. Forest troll culture is tribal and primitive. Though not as violent as their ice troll cousins, forest trolls nonetheless have a fearsome reputation in battle.

Ice trolls are a subspecies of troll that lives in cold climates. They have angular features, bright blue eyes, and mottled blue-white skin covered in hides and pelts. This troll has blue-white skin under grayish leather armor, and he sports a red mohawk. 

Ice trolls are generally evil and like most trolls, they are fierce protectors of their homes and may attack travelers to gain weapons, materials, clothing and food. They practice cannibalism and sometimes eat their slain enemies raw.

### Cannibalists and Voodooism
Cannibalism was a relatively common practice amongst trolls, although through the decades, and with their integration into the horde, their cannibalism had been frowned upon by most, and has since been made a forbidding practice by the horde, some still practice it, but non do so openly.

Not all trolls practice voodoo, but it is widespread. It was given to the trolls by their worshiped gods the Loa, and the exact emergence of voodoo among the trolls is unknown, for most tribes that possess such knowledge are unwilling to share it with outsiders.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:594px'></div>

### Tall and Muscular
Trolls are often tall, lanky, and muscular. They have both elven and orcish characteristics with their fierce fangs and long ears. Their long arms, strong legs and quick reflexes make them adept hunters. 

Trolls have only two fingers and a thumb on their hands, and they have only two toes on each foot. Some trolls have a toenail on their heels, and they do not wear standard shoes or boots due to their unusual foot shape and comfort in wading barefooted within different terrains.

### Affiliation
Trolls are members of the Horde. Although they practice voodoo and often have to retain from their savage nature, they are respected within the Horde, especially by the orcs. They feel a great debt to the horde and their time fighting alongside alongside its members have sprouted new friendships. Most tribes doesn't really hate the Alliance or its members, but their loyalty to the Horde and their blood&shy;thirsty nature makes the Alliance a great target. However, their respect for the Horde's warchief prevents them from waging private wars.

### Names 
Trolls are not given names at birth, instead a troll have to earn a name within their tribe. A troll's first name usually contains just one syllable, but as they prove themselves again and again, more syllables are added before or after their earned name.

No family or surnames exist within troll culture, although some choose to use their tribes name as a surname, a show of loyalty and pride. Some trolls use their position within a tribe as a surname, like Shadowhunter or Witch Doctor.

## Blood Elf
*We must put this misery behind us. We must enter a new chapter! And so I say to you that, as of this day, we are no longer high elves! In honor of the sacrifices of our brothers and sisters, our parents, and our children, as of this day we will take the name of our royal lineage! As of this day, we are sin'dorei! For Quel'Thalas!*

<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Kael'thas Sunstrider* &nbsp;</div>
<div style='margin-top:-5px'></div>

Nourished and strengthened by the Sunwell’s potent energies, the high elves’ enchanted kingdom of Quel'Thalas prospered within the verdant forests north of Lordaeron. 

During the Third War, the high elves were nearly scoured from Azeroth. Led by the death knight Arthas, the scourge army slaughtered almost all of the kingdom’s population. In the slaughter, Arthas tainted the sunwell, reanimating a lost necromancer. Prince Kael'thas rushed to his homeland's aid, and the survivors of the onslaught were renamed 'blood elves' in honor of their fallen kin. The blood elves grew addicted to the sunwells tainted energies. Kael'thas desperately searching for a cure for his kin, traveling the world to avenge his people and find a way to sate their hunger for magic.

Kael'thas assured his people he would return to Quel'Thalas and lead them to paradise, yet on Outland, the prince became twisted with the corrupting essence wielded by the demonic Burning Legion. Getting under the sway of the Legion's commander. The prince was later killed on his return to Quel'Thalas for his treachery, and with the aid of the draenei prophet, Velen, the magic taint lingering on the sunwell was vanquished, restore it as a fount of both arcane and holy energy.

Inspired by the Sunwell's rebirth, the blood elves have since entered into a shining new era in their ancient race's history. Although some elves remain hesitant to abandon their dependence on arcane magic, others have embraced change for the betterment of Quel'Thalas. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:664px'></div>

### A Crimson Appearance
As a culture, the sin'dorei have retained the look and feel of their fallen high elven kingdom, though have developed a greater penchant for the colour of crimson: the colour of their namesake. Crimson-red robes, decor and armour have become far more commonplace within blood elven society prior to the fall of the high elven people, a reference to the blood of their many brethren who had perished in the Third War. The iconic and traditional blood elven colours are red, gold, and to a lesser extent, blue – all of which can be seen on their racial crest, the Icon of Blood.

### Proud Society
In general, the blood elves are a proud, pragmatic, and somewhat jingoistic people; they place great emphasis on their love for their homeland, and are ruthless to their enemies. Their reputation for isolationism is well-earned, and they prefer to keep to their own kind, although excep-tions to this stereotype exist. Blood elves are a resilient race of survivors, and their most prominent figures stand as beacons of courage, tenacity, and the strength to fight on, regardless of what foes stand in their way.

### Beautiful and Graceful
Blood elves are both biologically and physically high elves, with the largest difference being the blood elves emerald glowing eyes, compared to the high elves blue glow. They are slenderly built, with an average height of 6 feet tall and a weight averaging at 150 pounds. They have long pointy ears, high cheekbones, and are generally considered to be highly attractive humans. Blood elves tend towards lighter colorations, with hair of blond or light brown. Both males and females often grow their hair long. Male blood elves ability to grow facial hair is limited, resulting in very few blood elves having beards beyond an inch.

### Affiliation
Blood elves are—for the most part—members of the Horde. Even though the elven race could be split into those that consider themselves blood elves and those that consider themselves high elves, the vast majority of these elves have pledged their allegiance to the Horde and chosen to honor their fallen by renaming themselves the sin'dorei.

Although blood elves have no hate towards the Alliance as a whole, the atrocities dealt to their kin by xenophobic humans have harbored a deep distrust of the Alliance and its human leaders.

***Blood Elf.*** These elves have pledged their allegiance to the Horde, having been convinced by the former Ranger General Sylvanas Windrunner and with her speaking on their behalf to the leaders of its cause.

***High Elf.*** These elves never pledged their allegiance to either faction, and even though they've worked alongside the Alliance in the past, they never trusted it enough to leave behind their isolated comfort and join its cause. The high elves have no love for the Horde and see blood elves as traitors, tainted by fel.

### Blood Elf Names
Most blood elves who survived the Third Ward have chosen to retain their high elven names. As such most blood elves continue to be given high elven names as birth, born into proud families with names of their own to carry forward. These elves share a connection with the sun that is quite prevalent in their choice of family names, with blood elven family names often being more aggreesive than those taken by most high elves.

***Age.*** Blood elves reach adulthood at the rate of humans, but aren't considered to have entered adulthood until they reach age 60, and can live to become many hundred years old with ease.

***Alignment.*** Blood elves live in a society where ranks and titles carry tremendous weight and where strict laws have been put in place for them to follow, pushing them towards lawful alignments. Personal desires varies drastically, and both those of good and evil alignment exist.

***Keen Senses.*** You are proficient in the Perception skill.

<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

- You have proficiency with the twinblade, warglaive, shortbow, and longbow.
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Thalassian. Thalassian derives from the Darnassian tongue of night elves, and in many cases sound the same to an inexperienced ear.

> ##### Creating a High Elf
> Few high elves remain on Azeroth, as the quel'dorei renamed themselves sin'dorei, blood elves, upon retaking much of their homeland from the Scourge. You can create a high elf by using the racial traits of a blood elf, as the two races are indistinguishable.

## Goblin
*I never cover up the things I'm proud of. If the world was gonna split in half tomorrow, I’d buy the Dark Portal, slap a toll booth on it, and charge refugees the last of their pocket change, the rings off their fingers, a bite of their meal, and a contractual obligation to build me a rocket palace in the skies of Nagrand. It’s the goblin way! Supply and demand! Deal with it!*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Trade Prince Jastor Gallywix* &nbsp;</div>
<div style='margin-top:-5px'></div>

Slaves of the jungle trolls on their home isle, forced to mine kaja'mite ore out of the volcanic bowels of Mount Kajaro. The ore had an unexpected effect on the goblins, granting them cunning intelligence. They began to rebel in secret, engineering artifacts, and brewing alchemical substances to successfully overthrow their oppressors and claim Kezan their homeland.

<span style="margin-left:10px"></span> Their prior prison become an expanding empire in the
<span style="margin-left:30px"></span> mines they had dugged. To their dismay, the effects of 
<span style="margin-left:35px"></span> the kaja'mite ore wore off, and their increased intelli-
<span style="margin-left:35px"></span> gence waned, as the ore itself became scarce and 
<span style="margin-left:34px"></span> dwindled. Their brilliant engineering dwindled in 
<span style="margin-left:30px"></span> ingenuity, looking haphazardly put together. Their 
<span style="margin-left:27px"></span> remaining craftiness and greed soon took its place, 
<span style="margin-left:23px"></span> lifting the race to preeminence as masters of mercan-
<span style="margin-left:20px"></span> tilism. Great fortunes were amassed, and the isle
<br><span style="margin-left:15px"></span> became a hub for goblin traders.

### Technology
Goblins love of mechanics often places them into direct competition with gnomes who enjoy similar devices. The competition between goblins and gnomes seems to be friendly. Whether clockwork shredders that allow a single goblin to do as much harvesting as 10 field hands or zeppelin-like airships that can ferry troops over otherwise impassable terrain, the goblins' inventions have become legendary. Such technological ingenuity is as central to the goblins' rise among the races as any trading prowess.

Even with the malfunctions and explosions that occur, goblin technology is proving to be of a quality that rivals the dwarves and their firearms. While other races often try to build reliable machines that would stay for grandchildren, goblin aims for device of the marginally bearable reliability that should only last enough to make its construction reasonable. Weird as it is, this approach allows to build more machines, or to build a more complex and powerful machine using the same time and resources.

### Born Traders
Goblins have taken to the role of merchants, and it's hard to travel for more than a week or two without stumbling across a goblin shop of some size. Goblin shops can be found nearly anywhere on Azeroth, seemingly regardless of whether or not there are towns nearby and heedless of dangers such as the Scourge. The goblins will sell anything to anyone, at only slightly inflated prices.

Though many shops remain independent, a growing number of them have signs declaring that they are owned and operated by the Venture Company, which the proprietors claim is headquartered in a faraway city ruled by goblins where the streets are paved with gold.

The goblins are also legendary for the sheer variety of trade in which they are willing to indulge and for their tenacity in bargaining.

### Small But Standing Tall
Goblins are slight and wiry, averaging just under 4 feet in height and an average weight of 50 pounds, with female goblins being slightly taller than males. Their green skin is reminiscent to the orcs, although goblins skin can tan in the sun to create rich and dull shades of green. Longside their large ears, goblin noses continue to grow throughout their life and can reach multiple inches.

### Affiliation
Goblins are members of the Horde. Even though goblins worked and traded with members of the Horde, it wasn't until the Cataclysm that the Bilgewater Cartel pledged their allegiance to the growing Horde. Although many goblins have allied themselves with the Horde, some continue to tread on neutral ground, trading with members of both factions who are willing to buy.

Few goblins openly show a hate or distrust for the other members of the Horde, enjoying the security and profitable positions they have earned within its ranks.

#### Goblins and Gnomes
Goblins bear a grudge towards gnomes, seeing them not as an enemy, but a rival. It has driven goblins into friendly and brutal contests with gnomes to determine which of the two races are superior.

### Names
Goblins are named at birth and keep their given name until they die. Although, some goblins take on nicknames fitting of their personality and put them before thier given name, like 'Haughty Modiste'. 

Goblins have large elaborate families with names <br>that depict some ancestor's achievements. A goblin whose own achievements out&shy;strip that of their forebears often replace their old family name with a new one depicting their own achievements.

You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Taur-ahe. Taur-ahe is a harsh, and low sounding language, without a proper alphabet, their written language is made of elaborate pictograms and pictoforms.

## Nightborne
An impenetrable barrier was placed around their capital city Suramar, shielding the highborne from the Sundering. This shield would keep the highborne isolated from the rest of Azeroth's new continents for thousands of years. Forcing the highbornes to rely on their Nightwell for their magical powers. The highbornes evolved over the ages, and they called themselves the shal'dorei or nightborne.

When Suramar run out of food, the shal'dorei began to utilize the substance of their Nightwell as nourishment and was thus spared an untimely death, however, this soon caused them to be unable to survive without drawing magic from the Nightwell. Crime was punished by exile. Cutting them off from the Nightwell, the exiled would diminish into husks of their former selves, and eventually irreversible into mindless withered, waiting for death.

Ten thousand years later the nightborne lowered their shield and surrender to the Burning Legion by orders from their leader, Grand Magistrix Elisande. Many nightborne did not agree with her decision, but none dared speak against her newfound forces of demons. Through the aid of a nightborne resistance, and the forces of the Alliance and Horde. The Grand Magistrix and her demon allies were pushed back into the Twisting Nether.

### Born in the Darkness
Sealed off within their capital of Suramar, the nightborne physique in many ways resemble that of their night elven kin, with tall slender bodies and muscular builds. The ever darkened sky of their city have changed their skin to be a dark blue or purple, rather than the more vibrant colors of the night elves. The Shal'dorei still practice arcane magic, giving their eyes a dim blue or purple glow, instead of the golden glow of the night elves.

The nightborne are fiercely proud of the arcane ways, and proudly shows off shimmering tattoos of arcane energy that has been placed upon their body. The tattoos have no known impact on the nightborne capabilities, yet it stands as a show of a nightbornes comprehension of the arcane.

### Highborne Civilization
The Shal'dorei have an air of superiority that often comes across as pompous. They revel in their unequalled magical civilization but having no exposure to the current races of Azeroth until the rebellion led an invading force to free Suramar, many still regard outside races and the world as it was back then, full of the unworthy, the uncultured, and low born far beneath the standards and levels of the nightborne civilization.

These were the less admirable qualities of night elven civilization back then, and the shal'dorei continue in them as if nothing has changed and as if they still remain the center of the world.

### Affiliation
Nightborne's have been severed from the rest of the world for thousands of years within their capitol city of Suramar. Derived from the highborne night elves, many nightborne have shown a desire for returning to their ancient kin once the barrier around their capital city was eliminated. How&shy;ever, nightborne also show an affecting towards the blood elves and their similar addiction to a well of power.

Few nightborne have maintained a neutral stance as the Third Invasion of the Burning Legion have pushed them to seek new allies. 

***Alliance.*** Few nightborne's have chosen to pledge their allegiance to the Alliance, feeling that the organization is too walled off and cloistered for a race that has spent the last ten-thousand years in isolation. The caution and mis&shy;trust voiced by their night elven kin has also pushed many nightborne away from the Alliance.

***Horde.*** Many nightborne have been able to find common ground with the blood elves of the Horde, who've expressed a similar relationship with the night elves, and are bound by a similar addiction to a well of power. The blood elves have showed themselves to be a great ally of the nightborne people and opened the door for them to join the Horde.

### Nightborne Names
Nightborne names resemble those of night elves and often carry a hidden meaning. Few nightbornes keep track of family names and surnames are derived from feats done by the nightborne's ancestors, it is rare for a nightborne to take a new surname as many take pride in their forefeather's achievements.

**Male Names:** Absolon, Astoril, Oculeth, Lespin, Silgryn, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almon, Ailen, Vanthir, Sylverin, Rosaine
<br>**Female Names:** Valtrois, Iadreth, Anastae, Ly'leth, Theryn, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ambrena, Anaryys, Naran, Ke'lorin, Arluelle, Noressa
<br>**Surnames Names:** Luneastre, Astravar, Swiftmeadow, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moonblade, Silverleaf

### Nightborne Traits

***Creature Type.*** You are a Humanoid. You are also considered an elf for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be an elf.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 1, and your Intelligence score increases by 2.

***Age.*** Nightborne reach physical maturity at the pace of humans, but the nightborne understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth. Nightbornes typically claim adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100, and can live to become thousands of years old. 

***Alignment.*** Order and structure are key to nightborne societies, they believe that reputation and status are of the utmost concern and that mortality and principles of right and wrong are viewed too often in that light. Most night&shy;borne are lawful.

***Size.*** Nightborne are between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 180 and 220 pounds. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Superior Darkvision.*** Accustomed to twilit forests <br> and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. Your nightborne heritage makes your darkvision un&shy;usual: everything you see in darkness is in a shade of violet.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.

***Arcane Knowledge.*** You are proficient in <br> the Arcana skill.

***Keen Senses.*** You are proficient in the Perception skill.

***Mental Warding.*** You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.

***Nightborne Magic.*** You know the *mage hand* cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the *detect magic* spell once per day. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the *blur* spell once per day. Intelligence is your spell&shy;casting ability for these spells.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Shalassian. Shalassian, like Thalassian, originates from the Darnassian language. Its dialect has been scrutinized through the ages, making it nearly impossible for members outside of the Nightborne to read or write.

## Pandaren
The pandaren have long been a mystery to other races of Azeroth, their history stretching back thousands of years, to before the raise of the kaldorei. Denizens of a wondrous and fertile land, the pandaren were slaves to the ancient titan-forged mogu. Through tenacity, diplomacy, and a unique form of unarmed combat, they staged a successful revolution that deposed the mogu, and established the foundation of the pandaren empire that prospered for thousands of years.

As the sundering took place, Pandaria was shrouded in a magical mist that would last for thousand of years. As the years came to an end, the mist around Pandaria unveiled. Drawing the attention of both factions, wishing to claim this 'unexplored' land, and learn of what lied on its surface.

### Harmony in All Things
Pandarens are slow to anger and prefer to take measures solutions to problems. On Pandaria, negative emotions are harnessed and take physical form to wreak havoc on the isle. They emphasize and cultivate a quiet life of inner harmony and focus. Conflicts, no matter how bitter, are quickly forgotten over cold drinks once the matter at hand has been resolved.

### A Spiritual Race
Pandaren have a fierce and deep belief in the connection of the material and spiritual world. They are a society that reacts, rather than being the ones to act first. Many claim to be the water that flows around a rock -- it never pushes the rocks out of its way, but merely goes around it. This stands as the core of their society, a simple means of everyday life. If they set their mind to a task and fail, then they believe they went about it the wrong way, and try again.

### Covered in Fur
Covered in colorful fur from head to toe, pandaren appear like massive humanoid bears towering above the heads of most of Azeroth's inhabitants. They stand far over the head of humans, ranging from just under 6 feet to a few inches short of 7 feet. Pandarens are naturally curvy, only made larger in size by their thick fur, weighing between 250 to 400 pounds. Males stand slightly taller than females, and males are often much heavier than females.

Pandaren colorations varies widely, from a dark brown to a golden yellow, one thing that is consistent throughout all pandarens are their white markings, all pandarens have these upon their face, and many also have patches of white on their paws of torso. Pandarens don't have hair, but many stylize their fur on top of their head, letting it grow longer to resemble hair.

### Affiliation
Pandarens are an independent race that have been hidden from the world since the days of the War of the Ancients. Their homeland of Pandaria lies far beyond the borders of the Horde and Alliance, and most pandarens have taken a neutral stance on the factions and their causes. However, some among the pandaren have pledged their allegiance to one of the factions, pledging their allegiance to the faction whose ideals and beliefs align with the pandaren.

The world and people of Azeroth is new to the pandaren  and few among the harmonious race show distrust, anger, or hate towards its other races. No matter their faction.

***Alliance.*** These pandaren are commonly known as tus&shy;hui pandaren, pandarens whose teachings encourage living a venerable life through meditation, rigorous training, and moral conviction. Pandaren who upheld the tenets of Tus&shy;hui are drawn to the Alliance and their similar philosophy.

***Horde.*** These pandaren are commonly known as houjin pandaren, pandarens who firmly believe that injustice must be met with a swift and decisive response, though this response should be flexible and calculated for the situation at hand; to the Huojin, the end will always ultimately justify the means. Pandaren who upload the tenets of Houjin are drawn to the scrappy practicality of the Horde.

### Names
Pandaren naming practices are similar to those of humans, each pandaren are given a name at birth, and carries on the family name of their parents. Some pandaren are known to take a new family name reflecting their own achievements in life, yet such practices are uncommon.
<div style='margin-top:-18px;'></div>

***Quaking Palm.*** You are able to target focal points on a target. As a bonus action, you can make a special unarmed attack. If the attack hits, it deals its normal damage and the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus). The target is stunned until the end of your next turn on a failed saving throw.

After you use your quaking palm, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Pandaren. Pandaren is the language of Pandaria, a descendant of the Mogu language forced upon the inhabitants of Pandaria by the mogu empire. It is a strange and unfamiliar language to the rest of Azeroth, with a multitude of words meaning one common thing.

## Void Elf
Infused by the void itself, the Ren'dorei--children of the void--are a group of blood elves exiled from their homeland of Quel'Thalas. Cast out for their teachings at the hand of the elven magister Umbric, the elves have embraced their newfound powers, though the inner turmoil it has caused may well follow them through their lives as they fight to maintain control over it.

### Shaped by the Void
While they are of the same blood as their elven siblings, void elves are best recognized for their pale or vibrant, blue-tinged skin and eyes. As well as the deep shades of blue and purple in their shadow-infused hair. For some void elves, their dark powers can be seen manifesting in their hair, leaving the tips shimmering with void energy.

Most who have tried to harness the corruptive powers of the void have fallen into madness. Among mortals, former ranger-general Alleria Windrunner stands as the first to properly wield it -- the elf now using her powers to guide her elven kin alongside the magister Umbric. The void elves aim, above all, to use their dangerous powers to defend both the Alliance and Azeroth itself. In doing so, they seek to prove wrong any who would doubt or judge their abilities.

### Exiled From Home
Originally, the void elves were the pupils and followers of Umbric -- a magister at the court of Silvermoon, who thought the void to be the key to the survival of Quel'Thalas after its destruction at the hands of the undead Scourge.

However, the other magisters did not agree. Least of all the Grand Magister, who ultimately banished the elves from the land under fear that the void would pose great dangers to the kingdom and to the Sunwell. 

Now, emboldened by their newfound powers, the void elves have sworn to make their claim on the world, under the joint leadership of magister Umbric and Alleria Windrunner. 

### Ethereals, Friend and Foe
Beings of energy, Ethereals are extradimensional creatures that have travelled great distances across the Great Dark. Normally composed of arcane energies, it is a group of void-touched Ethereals that have turned the Ren'dorei into what they are today. Alleria Windrunner, co-leader to Magister Umbric, owed much of her power to the teachings of an Ethereal named Locust-Walker.

It was only thanks to the machinations of void ethereals hoping to turn Magister Umbric and his followers into true creatures of void along with the timely intervention of Alleria Windrunner that has turned these former denizens of Quel'thalas into something more. Now Locust-Walker along with other ethereals who's goals aligned with the Ren'dorei roam their base of Telogrus Rift, teaching and guiding all Children of Quel'thalas in the ways of the Void.

### Affiliation
Void elves are an independent subrace of blood elves that have been exiled from Quel'Thalas for their meddling with the void. The elves choose to embrace or try to forget their status as outcasts, for they will forever be unwelcome in the land they've left behind.

***Alliance.*** These elves have learned to control the void following the guidance of the ranger-general Alleria Wind&shy;runner and have sworn their service to her. With her as their leader, they pledged their allegiance to the Alliance after the Burning Legion's defeat on Argus.

***Horde.*** No void elves exist within the Horde, as those that learned to control the void swore to follow the ranger-general Alleria Windrunner and have joined the Alliance.

> ##### Emergence of the Void Elves
> The Ren'dorei are specific group of void elves that followed the teachings of magister Umbric, though he is not the first elf to have dabbled with the void. Talk with your DM if you want to play as a void elf before the Burning Legion's defeat on Argus.

### Names
Void elves continue to follow the naming conventions of blood elves and little discrepancy exists between the two. However, with their exile from Quel'Thalas, some void elves have chosen to change their family name for one that embraces their new powers.

That being said, many void elves have lived for thousands of years due to the power of the Sunwell extending their lifespan indefinitely.

***Alignment.*** Although chaos and unpredictability is pro&shy;minent in many void elves, they have maintained a lawful alignment similar to blood elves. Those that succumb to the void often turn chaotic in their alignment.

## Vulpera
The vulpera have lived in Vol'dun as free traders and mer&shy;chants for countless generations. For much of that time, they have been oppressed by the Faithless sethrak, who have enslaved countless vulpera over the years and forced them to work and fight for them. The vulpera are mostly a passive people and as such never found the ability to stop the sethrak. At least one caravan tried to fight back, but they met only with defeat.

### Scavengers and Survivors
The vulpera are a keen and intelligent race of nomadic scavengers. They are capable of turning what they find into opportunities to thrive and are skilled at solving problems, no matter their size. Despite their small stature, vulpera are fierce and cunning in battle, bringing down any enemy foolish enough to underestimate them. While they have permanent settlements in burrows, their caravans mostly travel from hideaway to hideaway, scavenging for supplies, trading them where they can, and spreading information they pick up along the way. Their scavenging often takes the form of looting artifacts and treasure from ancient ruins and selling them to the highest bidder.

### Resourceful Gatherers
Dwelling in Vol'dun, the vulpera can't afford to waste re&shy;sources. Over time, they have learned to take anything that looks even remotely useful and be creative using what they have, and they have learned to recognize value wherever it hides in the desert. When warned that gold from the Port of Zem'lan was cursed, Norah replied that "A little curse never kept the vulpera from a worthy treasure".
