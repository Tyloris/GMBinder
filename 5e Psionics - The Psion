\pagebreakNum

### Psionics
*1st-level psion feature* <br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

As a student of psionics, you can master and use psionic talents and disciplines. Psionics is a special form of magic use, distinct from spellcasting.

#### Psionic Talents
A psionic talent is a minor psionic ability you have mastered. You know two psionic talents of your choice. You learn additional talents of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Talents Known column of the Psion table.

#### Psionic Disciplines
A psionic discipline is a rigid set of mental exercises that allows a psion to manifest psionic power. A psion masters only a few disciplines at a time, and choses them from the Psionic Discipline list.

You know one psionic discipline of your choice. The Disciplines Known column of the Psion table shows the total number of disciplines you know at each level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one discipline you know with a different one of your choice.

#### Psionic Power
You have an internal reservoir of energy that can be devoted to psionic disciplines you know. This energy is represented by Psionic Energy dice, each of which is a d6. The Psion table shows how many dice you have.

Some of your discipline powers expend the Psionic Energy die they use, as specified in a power's description, and you can't use a power if it requires you to use a die when your dice are all expended. You regain all your expended Psionic Energy dice when you finish a long rest. In addition, as a bonus action, you can regain one expended Psionic Energy die, but you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

When you reach certain levels in this class, the size of your Psionic Energy dice increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).

#### Psi Limit
Though you have access to a potent amount of psionic energy, it takes training and practice to channel that energy. There is a limit on the number of psi points you can spend to activate a psionic discipline. The limit is based on your psion level, as shown in the Psi Limit column of the Psion table. For example, as a 3rd-level psion, you can spend no more than 3 psi point son a discipline each time you use it, no matter how many psi points you have.

#### Psychic Focus??
<!-- You can focus psionic energy on one of your psionic disciplines to draw ongoing benefits from it. As a bonus action, you can choose one of your psionic disciplines and gain its psychic focus benefit, which is detailed in that discipline’s description. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a different focus benefit. You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn’t limit your ability to use other disciplines. -->

#### Psionic Ability
Intelligence is your psionic ability for your psionic disciplines. You use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psionic discipline or when making an attack roll with one.

<div style="text-align: center">

**Discipline save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Discipline attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

</div>

### Autohypnosis
*2nd-level psion feature* <br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You have trained your mind to gain mastery over your body and the mind’s own deepest capabilities. You gain the following benefits:

___
- **Learn.** You can learn a new tool proficiency or language in half the time.
- **Memorize.** 
- **Recall.** 
- **Willpower.** When reduced to 0 hit points, you can use a reaction to remain conscious. You must still make death saving throws as normal.

Check: The DC and the effect of a successful check depend on the task you attempt.

Task                    | DC
------------------------|-----------
Ignore caltrop wound    | 18
Memorize                | 15
Resist dying            | 20
Resist fear             | Fear effect DC
Tolerate poison         | Poison’s DC
Willpower               | 20

*Ignore Caltrop Wound:* If you are wounded by stepping on a caltrop, your speed is reduced to one-half normal. A successful Autohypnosis check removes this movement penalty. The wound doesn’t go away—it is just ignored through self-persuasion.

*Memorize:* You can attempt to memorize a long string of numbers, a long passage of verse, or some other particularly difficult piece of information (but you can’t memorize magical writing or similarly exotic scripts). Each successful check allows you to memorize a single page of text (up to 800 words), numbers, diagrams, or sigils (even if you don’t recognize their meaning). If a document is longer than one page, you can make additional checks for each additional page. You always retain this information; however, you can recall it only with another successful Autohypnosis check.

*Resist Dying:* You can attempt to subconsciously prevent yourself from dying. If you have negative hit points and are losing hit points (at 1 per round, 1 per hour), you can substitute a DC 15 Autohypnosis check for your d% roll to see if you become stable. If the check is successful, you stop losing hit points (you do not gain any hit points, however, as a result of the check). You can substitute this check for the d% roll in later rounds if you are initially unsuccessful.

*Resist Fear:* In response to any fear effect, you make a saving throw normally. If you fail the saving throw, you can make an Autohypnosis check on your next round even while overcome by fear. If your autohypnosis check meets or beats the DC for the fear effect, you shrug off the fear. On a failed check, the fear affects you normally, and you gain no further attempts to shrug off that particular fear effect. 

*Tolerate Poison:* You can choose to substitute an Autohypnosis check for a saving throw against any standard poison’s secondary damage or effect. This skill has no effect on the initial saving throw against poison. 

*Willpower:* If reduced to 0 hit points (disabled), you can make an Autohypnosis check. If successful, you can take a normal action while at 0 hit points without taking 1 point of damage. You must make a check for each strenuous action you want to take. A failed Autohypnosis check in this circumstance carries no direct penalty—you can choose not to take the strenuous action and thus avoid the hit point loss. If you do so anyway, you drop to –1 hit points, as normal when disabled.

Action: None. Making an Autohypnosis check doesn’t require an action; it is either a free action (when attempted reactively) or part of another action (when attempted actively).

Try Again: Yes, for memorize and willpower uses, though a success doesn’t cancel the effects of a previous failure. No for the other uses.

Synergy: If you have 5 or more ranks in Autohypnosis, you get a +2 bonus on Knowledge (psionics) checks.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Concentration, you get a +2 bonus on Autohypnosis checks.

### Ability Score Improvement
*4th-level psion feature* <br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th,16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Psionic Versatility (Optional)
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one talent you learned from this class's Psionic feature with another cantrip from the psion talent list.

### Force of Will
*7th-level psion feature* <br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You can use the immense power of your mind to better fend off mental attacks. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

#### Create Psicrystal
Using a 1 hour long ritual, you cause a splinter fragment of your personality to manifest in the form of a crystalline construct. It appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 10 feet and uses the Psicrystal stat block. You can only have one psicrystal at a time.

___
- **Combat.** The psicrystal is an ally to you and your companions, and it obeys you. In combat, it shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. On its turn, the psicrystal takes the dodge action and moves to avoid danger, unless you use your bonus action to command it to attack instead.
- **Repair.** While your psicrystal is within 10 feet, you can focus your mind for 1 minute, rolling a Psionic Energy die and adding your Intelligence modifier to the total (with a minimum bonus of +1). The psicrystal regains hit points equal to the total. If you or the psicrystal dies, it crumbles to powder.
- **Remote Viewing.** As an action, you can see what your psicrystal sees and hear what it hears until the end of your next turn.
- **Resonant Personality.** While the psicrystal is within 30 feet, whenever you make an ability check related to your psicrystal's personality, as shown on the Psicrystal Personality table, you can roll a Psionic Energy die and add it to the roll.
- **Deepened Link (5th Level).** You can communicate telepathically with your psicrystal as	long as you two are on the same plane of existence. Additionally, while perceiving through your psicrystal’s senses, you can also speak through your psicrystal in your own voice.

#### Inertial Armor
While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier.

>___
> ***Psychic Bond.*** You can add your proficiency bonus to any ability check or saving throw that the psicrystal makes.
>
> ***Evasion.*** If the psicrystal is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails. It can't use this trait if it's incapacitated.
> 
> ***False Appearance.*** While the psicrystal remains motionless and isn’t flying, it is indistinguishable from a normal crystal.
> 
> ***Spider Climb.*** The psicrystal can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
> 
> <h3 style="font-size:1vw">Actions (Requires Your Bonus Action)</h3>
>
> ***Psychic Strike.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* your spell attack modifier to hit, range 30 ft., one target you can see. *Hit:* 1d4 + PB psychic damage.  
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Channel Psionics.*** The psicrystal delivers a spell you cast that has a range of touch. The psicrystal must be within 120 feet of you.

#### Astral Construct
*Psionic power*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You project an ethereal creation from your mind at a space you can see within range, taking the shape of a Medium or smaller creature, weapon, or other object. This creation is clearly ethereal in nature. When you create it, and on subsequent turns using your action to mentally control it, you can move it up to 30 feet in any direction and attack, so long as it doesn’t move beyond the range of the power. To attack with it, make a melee spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 force damage. If the Astral Construct moves out of range of the spell, it fades away into nothing, ending the spell.

While the Astral Construct is active, you can spend psi points up to your per use limit to issue commands that affect and empower your construct. Commands require no action, but you can’t exceed your psi point limit in total commands issued, and each command can only be issued once per turn.

**Grab (1 psi point):** Can only be used while your construct is Solidified. A target creature within 5 feet of your construct that is no more than one size larger than the construct must make a Strength saving throw or become restrained by the construct. At the end of each of the restrained creature’s turns it can repeat the saving throw. The condition ends if the construct becomes ethereal again, or becomes more than one size smaller than the target.

**Grow (1 psi point):** Your construct increases by one size, and its number of damage dice increases by one. It returns to its normal size at the start of your next turn. It can only gain one additional die (for example, up to 2d8).

**Relocate (1 psi point):** The construct disappears and reappears anywhere within 60 feet of you. 

**Replicate (3 psi points):** You use Relocate, but the original doesn’t disappear. Until the end of your turn, you have another construct and control both with the same action (commands only affect one of your choice). Pick one construct to fade at the start of your next turn or use Sustain.

**Solidify (1 psi point):** Your construct becomes solid, blocking its space until the start of your next turn. You can only use this command if it is in an unoccupied space. It has an armor class of 16 and hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier + your psion level. The construct becomes ethereal again if it drops to zero hit points.

**Strike (2 psi points):** The construct makes an attack (even if it has already attacked).

**Sustain (1+ psi points):** At the start of your turn, you can sustain the effect of a Solidify, Grow or Replicate command for an additional round. An effect that has been replicated can be sustained across all replicated constructs with a single use, but each effect can only be sustained once per turn (for example, you can never sustain more than one replicated construct). This costs 1 psi point for each effect sustained. Sustaining Solidify refreshes the construct’s hit points to its maximum.

## Power Displays (EPH)
When a power is manifested, a display may accompany the primary effect. This secondary effect may be auditory, material, mental, olfactory, or visual. No power’s display is significant enough to create consequences for the psionic creatures, allies, or opponents during combat. The secondary effect for a power occurs only if the power’s description indicates it.

If multiple powers with similar displays are in effect simultaneously, the displays do not necessary become more intense. Instead, the overall display remains much the same, though with minute spikes in intensity. A Psicraft check (DC 10 + 1 per additional power in use) reveals the exact number of simultaneous powers in play.

*Dispense with Displays:* Despite the fact that almost every power has a display, a psionic character can always choose to manifest the power without the flashy accompaniment. To manifest a power without any display (no matter how many displays it might have), a manifester must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the power). This check is part of the action of manifesting the power. If the check is unsuccessful, the power manifests normally with its display.

Even if a manifester manifests a power without a display, he is still subject to attacks of opportunity in appropriate circumstances. His faraway gaze, the focus on something other than the material world, and the split-second of focus required to manifest a power distract the manifester’s attention sufficiently to warrant the attack. (Of course, another Concentration check can be made as normal to either manifest defensively or maintain the power if attacked.)

*Customizing Displays:* The DM may substitute a standard display effect (see below) for another specific effect appropriate to his or her campaign. Alternatively, a player may wish to customize his displays. For instance, powers with a material display might produce “fairy dust” instead of an ectoplasmic sheen. Once a given display is customized, its effects do not vary for that campaign or character. 

**Auditory:** A bass-pitched hum issues from the manifester’s vicinity or in the vicinity of the power’s subject (manifester’s choice), eerily akin to many deep-pitched voices. The sound grows in a second from hardly noticeable to as loud as a shout strident enough to be heard within 100 feet. At the manifester’s option, the instantaneous sound can be so soft that it can be heard only within 15 feet with a successful DC 10 Listen check. Some powers describe unique auditory displays.

**Material:** The subject or the area is briefly slicked with a translucent, shimmering substance. The glistening substance evaporates after 1 round regardless of the power’s duration. Sophisticated psions recognize the material as ectoplasmic seepage from the Astral Plane; this substance is completely inert.

**Mental:** A subtle chime rings once in the minds of creatures within 15 feet of either the manifester or the subject (at the manifester’s option). At the manifester’s option, the chime can ring continuously for the power’s duration. Some powers describe unique mental displays.

**Olfactory:** An odd but familiar odor brings to mind a brief mental flash of a long-buried memory. The scent is difficult to pin down, and no two individuals ever describe it the same way (to one creature the odor may be similar to burning wood, while to her companion it smells like honeysuckle). The odor originates from the manifester and spreads to a distance of 20 feet, then fades in less than a second (or lasts for the duration, at the manifester’s option).

**Visual:** The manifester’s eyes burn like points of silver fire while the power remains in effect. A rainbow-flash of light sweeps away from the manifester to a distance of 5 feet and then dissipates, unless a unique visual display is described. This is the case when the Display entry includes “see text,” which means that a visual effect is described somewhere in the text of the power. For instance, the Display entry for astral construct is “Visual; see text.” The text indicates that a construct is formed. The construct, as a visible object, is the visible display for the astral construct power.

## Power displays (D20PFSRD)
Virtually all psionic powers carry some sort of secondary display. This might be a flash of light, a particular scent, or a humming sound. Yet the standard rules only give options for a single display effect for each type of display – auditory, material, mental, olfactory, and visual. What if you want your character to have varying displays based upon a particular personality? The rules outline a way to change a single display for one character, but not a way to make these displays the truly mutable side-effects they should be.

Presented below are a variety of new displays for manifested powers. Although they may change the look and feel of a power, they carry no mechanical changes. The powers are still identified in the same fashion, the powers still have the same primary effects, and no special rolls are needed to choose any of these effects. These are presented simply as a way to differentiate one manifester from another when using psionic power.

The first section presented will give a variety of new displays for each of the five display types. This allows the easiest method of customizing displays by simply choosing a different display instead of the default effect.

The second section presents options for combination effects, because maybe you don’t want the display effects of a power to be separate. This allows a manifester’s displays to have a single, multi-part display effect, rather than several separate effects that do not relate to each other.

The third section offers new groups of displays. This section will offer, for example, a group of displays to use with just powers with the fear descriptor. Or new displays to use on powers of the creation subdiscipline. Fear powers and creation powers are quite different and this allows the display effects to reflect this distinction.

The final section presents display themes. These themes might be for a single character, or a single set of powers, at your discretion. An example would be a psychic warrior from a village where totems are worshipped instead of gods. This psychic warrior’s powers might have displays that reflect his totem, rather than anything else.

All of the options presented here are completely optional and can be used together or separately. You might decide that the theme option makes the most sense for your character, or perhaps the theme option along with the display groups options, allowing your kineticist’s energy powers to wreathe him in energy, while his other visual displays show a burst of sparkling mist. In addition, you might think of more options for displays – this is encouraged, as the lists presented below are far from exhaustive.

Enjoy your manifestations! Your character should be truly unique and the options presented here are an effort to do just that.

### New Displays
Presented below are a variety of new displays for use with manifestations. Each type of display – auditory, material, mental, olfactory, and visual – has new display options. These options can be used individually or combined together; they simply offer some new options and a framework for creating your own. Choosing new displays does not require any particular feats, skill ranks, or class features; any manifester can choose Alternate displays – with the GM’s permission.

\columnbreak
#### Auditory Displays
The following displays apply to powers that carry an auditory display type.
- Those within 15 ft. hear the sound of stampeding animals rushing past the manifester.
- A scale of musical notes plays, growing louder, the more powerful the power is or the longer the manifestation takes. The manifester sings while manifesting, the manifestation adding additional voices to his song or variations as if a chorus.

- A frightening high-pitched scream or a low moaning erupts from the manifester.
- The sound of a sword being drawn fills the air around the manifester.
- Low, whispering voices fill the area, speaking in what sounds like a long-lost language, as if they were ghosts or apparitions from another age.

- Small leaves and roots sprout from the manifester’s hair or from his feet, burrowing into nearby soil, but soon rot and fall away.
- The manifester grows crystals that appear to pierce his skin and fall away from him.
- Each time the manifester manifests a power, a small astral creature appears on his shoulder, as if it was an imp or other otherworldly creature. Some take the form of devils; others look like fey, angels, or aberrations, at the manifester’s discretion.
- Those near the manifester are covered in crawling insects. If the power is powerful enough, these manifest inside the mouth and ears of those too close. This effect ends after one second.

\pagebreak

- A memory of a lost friend or love is drawn forth in those around the manifester.
- A flash of loneliness washes over those around the manifester as they realize how alone they truly are in a harsh world.
- Those who are within 10 feet of the manifester feel guilty, as if they had done something horrible, although they cannot remember what causes the feeling of guilt. The feeling fades after a few seconds.

#### Olfactory Displays
The following displays apply to powers that carry an olfactory display type.
- The smell of iron, as if from blood, fills the area 15 feet around the manifester.

- All sources of light flicker and fade for a split second before the manifestation is complete.
- A symbol of some sort (religious symbol, philosophical or even magical) manifests over the manifester, shining brightly. This symbol becomes larger and shines more the higher the level of the power or the longer it takes to manifest.
- Shining motes of multicolored light stream from the manifester in all directions, or towards the target or targets of the power, at the manifester’s option.
- Energy seems to crackle off the manifester, either in the form of lightning bolts, dropping flames, icicles or even sickly green drops of ectoplasm. The effect has no substance and causes no harm.
- A host of spectral figures surround the manifester for the duration of the manifestation.
- Roots shoot up from the ground and around the manifester before disappearing.

### Combination Displays
For some powers, the various displays should be directly related, rather than two or more disjointed displays. Presented below are a variety of new displays for combinations of different display types.

In addition, GMs are encouraged to allow players to change the displays of powers, as long as the overall feel of the displays fits the theme of the power. Because altered displays do not modify the actual power, or the ability to identify the power, changing the display should not carry any mechanical or balance concerns.

#### 2-Part Combinations
The displays below are for when a power has two displays. In addition, if a power has more than two displays, one of the options below and a different third option might be selected.

##### Auditory and Material

##### Auditory, Material, and Mental
- A howling wind, carrying the screams of the dying, swirls around those near the manifester, giving a strong feeling of unease.

#### 5-Part Combinations
Although there are no known powers that have all five display types, two new displays are presented below for just such an instance.
