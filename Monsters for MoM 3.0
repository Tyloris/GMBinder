## Cloud Serpents
A cloud serpent is a long, sinuous serpent-like dragon native to Pandaria. It is continually born aloft by the winds, eternally swimming through the air. While it is considered a dragon, it bears no connection to the dragonflights and while intelligent, it is closer to a particularly cunning animal than the keen intellect of a true dragon.

***Fragile Balance.*** While the elder cloud serpents are as deadly a creature as any that exists on Azeroth, the eggs and hatchlings are almost paradoxically weak. Their young can only be found in specific isolated locations and need to be fiercely protected by their guardians.

***Power of the Storm.*** According to myth, the first cloud serpent was born from a lake set aflame by the lightning of the Thunder King. Ever since, the cloud serpent have had a special connection to the storm. As they grow in age and power, they become more inured to its effects and eventually some are able to bring forth their inner storm through their breath or their mere presence.

***Order of the Cloud Serpent.*** Thousands of years ago, a young pandaren girl found an injured hatchling. Though cloud serpents were feared at that time as violent and aggressive beasts, Jiang chose to care for and raise the cloud serpent Lo into an honored companion who went on to save her life from a troll and later proved their worth as deadly companions to the pandaren defenders.

\columnbreak
<div style='margin-top:563px'></div>

Jiang then went on to found the Order of the Cloud Serpent, an order of flying pandaren warriors. While wild cloud serpents cannot be tamed to act as mounts, when one is raised from an egg to adolescence, they can prove to be eternally loyal beasts.

***Ancient Powers.*** While most cloud serpents who survive to adulthood become powerful creatures in their own right, something more is needed to push them to the power of an ancient cloud serpent. These creatures almost always have a connection to some powerful being or place.

***Multicolored.*** There are five primary colors found among the cloud serpents. While each has different attitudes and associations among pandaren folklore, but there are no real differences in their abilities. The five kinds of cloud serpents are:
___
- **Azure.** These creatures are associated as being harbingers of good fortune. 
- **Crimson.** These cloud serpents are given to flights of fancy, often striking out on a whim for seemingly random journeys, sometimes for days at a time.
- **Golden.** Golden cloud serpents are very rare and a sight to behold, considered a national treasure.
- **Jade.** The most common kind of cloud serpent, jade serpents are particularly quick to violence when threatened.
- **Onyx.** Among the most rare of cloud serpents, these stealthy creatures are aggressive and deadly.

### A Cloud Serpent's Lair
While younger cloud serpents are known to be free-spirited wanderers, ancient cloud serpents usually stick to a single location, though their territory still encompasses several square miles.

#### Regional Effects
The territory of an ancient cloud serpent is changed by its inner storm, which creates on or more of the following effects:
- The air in a 6 mile radius crackles with static electricity. Large amounts of metal can invite lightning strikes.
- The cloud serpent can change the shape and color of clouds on a whim.
- The cloud serpent can alter the weather at will in a 6-mile radius. The effect is identical to the *control weather* spell. When precipitation reaches stage 4 or higher, it is considered a thunderstorm.

If the cloud serpent dies, the effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

\columnbreak

> ##### Variant: Thundering Cloud Serpent
> Some cloud serpents manifest their inner storm more powerfully than other cloud serpents. They have the ***Lightning Absorption*** and ***Static Skin*** traits. 
> 
> ***Lightning Absorption.*** Whenever the cloud serpent is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and regains a number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt.
> 
> ***Static Skin.*** The cloud serpent deals an additional 3 (1d6) lightning damage with its melee attacks and creatures that hit the cloud serpent with a melee attack take 3 (1d6) lightning damage. The cloud serpent also has disadvantage on Stealth checks, except when in a thundercloud, where it has advantage instead.

## Drakeadon
In the shadowy peak of Blackrock Mountain, the black dragon Nefarian executed many sick and twisted experiments using the blood and bodies of dragons. This resulted in the creation of his chromatic dragons; but never content to let progress lie still, Nefarian saw fit to further experiment. The exact methods are thankfully lost to time, but the result was a hideous amalgamation of draconic and elemental features, a breed of two-headed monsters of opalescent scales, immense power, and uncontrollable aggression.

***Chromatic Instability.***  Drakeadons possess the same physical properties as Nefarian's other chromatic experiments, with the combined strengths and weaknesses of many breeds of dragon; however, their bodies are unstable and shift form and function constantly, ever changing their color and power.

***Blackwing's Pride.*** As perhaps Nefarian's greatest creations, the few living Drakeadons were seen exclusively guarding his lair in Blackrock Mountain. Held in chains and cages, they were barely able to be  controlled, and lashed out at any intruders that dared encroach their master's sanctum.

***Elemental Anomalies.*** The nature of the experiments that spawned these abominations is unknown - however it is believed by some explorers that the dragon spawned them using the essence of the elemental core hounds, the favored pets of Nefarian's hated enemy, Ragnaros the Firelord. Were this true, it would demonstrate yet further the depths of the black dragon's depraved approach to science.

## Dragons
Among the greatest of all living beings on the face of Azeroth, dragons are creatures who live up to their many legends. Their power is great as great as their beauty is majestic; a tremendous force to be reckoned with. 

Mature dragons are often larger than other creatures they might encounter, and their fangs and claws strong enough to destroy who might oppose them. To top it all off, most dragons are fortified further still with innate magical power. All of this taken into consideration, it is easy to see how their history is intricately twined with that of Azeroth itself -- in ways that few other beings can boast.

Their connection with the world is innate; born from both their heritage and from the power of the Dragon Aspects. With its first breath of life, a dragon will weave a bond with the world with the world around it, and when its death comes to pass it does so to a tremendous upheaval; causing earthquakes, floods, and suchlike.

Even young dragons, those who have not established as close a bond to the spiritual world, still make ripples in the fabric of reality when they die. Although these ripples are not always seen or felt by other races, they nonetheless garner the attention of other dragons.

### Dragon Lives

The life spans of dragons have not been accurately measured, but they are known to live for several centuries. A dragon begins its life as a **whelp** (or whelpling), growing from there in both size and power until it becomes a **drake** within five to ten years. After about a century or so, a drake reaches full maturity as a **dragon** -- before taking centuries therafter to become a **wyrm**.

### Interacting With Dragons
Each dragon is as individual as any mortal creature. They have their dreams, personality, quirks, and traits to make them stand out on their own. Still, there are a number of similarities that run through each dragonflight, and some that run through dragons as a whole. Some of these similarities are innate, others cultural, and others still drawn from painful lessons learned in ages past.

***Distant and Grand.*** Dragons interact with the mortal races with fair infrequency. They prefer the company of their own kind, or even complete isolation, to that of creatures whose lives can be measured in mere decades. In this light, if they do have to deal with mortals, they are often more inclined to interact with longer-lived races -- elves in particular, and often dwarves as well.

There is an exception to this tendency with the green and red dragonflights. Green dragons, as protectors of the natural world and the Emerald Dream, sometimes seek the aid of druids and their allies. Red dragons, in their part as protectors of life, are said to discreetly seek out mortals for the satisfaction of secretly living among them.

***Long Perspective.*** Whatever the situation, it is typical for a dragon to take a sometimes exceptionally long approach; content to seed events that may not see fruition for decades, or even centuries. As long as their lives can last, sometimes even reaching millennia, they are rarely wont for time to see their plans through to the end.

In the company of mortals, a dragon may very well forget that such creatures often prefer plans to take form in just a few years -- or even sooner, if possible!

\pagebreakNum

***A Familiar Form.***  Dragons of the five flights are masters of true shapeshifting; at will, they may shrink and alter their shape to match any mortal race. Though this is often used to retain a disguise, particularly by the Bronze dragons who may wish to walk among history, the most common use of this trick is actually free of deceit. 

Many dragons will choose a mortal form that they find comfortable, and which reflects their personality or true self; sometimes retaining draconic features such as horns, crests or unique armor, and otherwise being fully open that they are dragons still. This is often used to liaise with much smaller mortals, but some dragons far prefer to stand as mortals even in spare time, perhaps finding it freeing from the shape granted to them by birth.

### Dragonflights
Dragons are grouped together by type, referred to as dragonflights. There are only five true or "greater" dragonflights, each headed by a Dragon Aspect: black, blue, bronze, green, and red. From these have spawned at least three lesser dragonflights--infinite, netherwing, and twilight--who are the results of unnatural circumstances. All other dragons do not qualify as true dragonflights, though laymen sometimes refer to them as such.

Each of the greater dragonflights has a location where they go to when their life is at an end, known as a dragonshrine. Each of the dragonshrines--the Obsidian, Azure, Bronze, Emerald, and Ruby Dragonshrines for black, blue, bronze, green, and red dragons respectively--is considered sacred for every dragonflight and is located in the region of Northrend known as Dragonblight. Nearby is the Wyrmrest Temple, an immense Titan structure used as an ancient meeting place for the five dragonflights.

### The Dragon Aspects
Long ago, the titan-forged Keeper Tyr stood against Galakrond, an immense beast known as the Father of Dragons, who consumed other proto-dragons to increase his horrific power. It was only with the aid of five remarkable proto-dragons who stood by his side that Tyr was victorious.

These five proto-dragons were Alexstrasza, Malygos, Neltharion, Nozdormu, and Ysera. By the power of the Titans, they were each transformed into the first dragons and bestowed the title of Aspect.

They were immortal, given charge of each their own domain on Azeroth and the tremendous power to keep it. With them, other dragons who shared kinship with any of the five were held to the same charge. They would watch over all aspects of life with vigilance, feeling the weight of their responsibilities upon their very souls. 

### Dragons
As a dragon grows older, each stage of its life is distinctly unique from the last; not only growing larger, but also considerably more powerful. These stages are generally similar across all greater and lesser dragonflights.

#### Dragonwhelp
A dragonwhelp typically measures around 4 ft. from its snout to its tail as it emerges from its egg -- in which it has already been conscious for some time. Though physically weak, and thus rarely left alone, even a newly hatched whelp hold a significant magical aptitude.

\columnbreak

#### Drake
It only takes a few years for a whelp to become a drake, a fairly explosive growth by any measure, before staying as such for decades to come. Given to their youth, drakes on their own can be quick to act; preferring swift and decisive action over the slow deliberation of their older kin. 

#### Dragon
By the time a drake has reached full maturity as a dragon, a century or more, it has had more than enough time to experience the world -- and to draw wisdom from it. Even among flights who keep close together, a mature dragon is very likely try and keep its own lair secluded.

#### Wyrm
Should a dragon live long enough, centuries down the line, it will eventually become a wyrm. They are the oldest and most venerable of their flight, keeping scores of dragons under their wings and within their domain, standing second only to the Aspects themselves. 

**[Unique appearance descriptor: Maybe throw in a brief description in the Wyrm section that adds what physical attributes make them distinct - specifically longer beards, horns, frills, moustaches, unique tail clubs, whatever. Might help DMs.]**

**[Note: Apparently the unique descriptors for certain Aspects, like Alexstrasza's oversized horns, are supposed to be reflected in the dragonflight as a whole--ie, all red dragons have larger horns. The fact that they share a single model is due to graphical limitations.]**

### Dragonkin
There are other creatures that serve the dragonflights, usually under the command of older dragons and wyrms. Though they are not true dragons themselves, they all remain closely tied members of their respective flight.

How these creatures came to be is a well-guarded secret, known only to the dragons themselves; none of whom are particularly forthcoming with this information. 

#### Dragonspawn
The dragonspawn are monstrous beings trained to guard and to care for their respective dragonflight; acting as soldiers, assistants, or even companions. Just like the dragons themselves, they are endowed with a great number of virtuous qualities and mystic abilities.

Drawing comparisons to other creatures, they share similarities with centaurs -- having a lower body with four legs and a humanoid upper body with arms. Unlike centaurs however, they are lizard-like in every way; their bodies decked in scales. Some have been seen to have wings, though never large enough to permit flight.

#### Drakonid
The drakonid are typically described as half-man, half-dragon -- though just like with the dragonspawn, a dragon would never confirm whether there is anything to draw from this observation or if it is merely a coincidence.

They are towering creatures that walk on two legs, reaching far taller than any mortal that would cross their path, and make great use of their impressive strength in the work they do for the flight they serve.

### Greater Dragonflights
In ages past, when the largest of dragons, Galakrond, reigned over the land, scores of proto-dragons of countless colours flitted across the skies of ancient Kalimdor. Through time and change, few remain, and those that have stood the test of time and risen most to prominence are called the Greater Dragonflights, or Prime Dragonflights; blessed by the gods of Azeroth, the five flights - red, black, blue, bronze, and green - were charged with safeguarding Azeroth, and representing the fundamental forces of nature.

***The Dragon Aspects.*** Each of the dragonflights has a charge, a sacred duty, and among them no dragon exemplifies their role than the Dragon Aspect, each one empowered as an aspect of their granted domain, the ruler of their flight and typically the mother or father of most of it. These five dragons are the oldest, wisest and by far the most powerful of dragonkind, closer to gods than any other creature on Azeroth. They possess wisdom and memory aeons long, and seek nothing less than total peace across Azeroth, for the sake of her occupants and their own children.

***The Charge of the Dragonflights.*** Each dragonflight has been charged with an eternal duty, and each dragon within their birth flight possesses fantastic powers pertaining to their charge. Intelligent from the egg, each dragon takes their flight's charge extremely seriously, and it is a rare dragon that is not acting in their brood's best interests. Between flights there has been some contention, from derisive belief in other broods' "inferior" charges to competition, but the dragonflights collectively understand that, when all is done, their charge is for the good of Azeroth, not themselves.

#### Black Dragonflight
Where the other flights are kind, loyal or focused on Azeroth's protection, the black dragonflight are cruel, backstabbing and obsessed with the destruction of life, and toppling of kingdoms.

Long ago, the Black Dragonflight and its elder were charged with the protection over the Earth itself, and given a deep and intimate connection to Azeroth. In those days, the dragonflight were Azeroth's most ardent and stalwart defenders, able in one breath to extinguish and re-ignite a volcano, willing to go to any length to defend their friends, and eternally vigilant of corruption in the heart of Azeroth.

However, at the turn of an age, the Aspect of Earth was driven insane, and corrupted his entire brood with that same insanity. A war that ended in calamity for dragonkind cemented the Black Dragonflight's place as the betrayers, the dragons of death and evil, and enemies of all of Azeroth.

#### Blue Dragonflight
Granted the grand task of watching over the realm of magic and enchantment across Azeroth, to ensure that the planet's latent powers are never abused, the Blue Dragonflight have perhaps the loftiest attitude towards their role, and perform it with feeling.

Almost driven to extinction at the advent of the Black Dragonflight's turn to evil, the blue flight is reclusive and secular, refusing any interaction with mortals with few exceptions and hoarding arcane knowledge and artifacts for themselves in their cultural home in Northrend. A blue dragon is an intensely intelligent, crafty being, inclined more towards riddles and puzzles than to combat and active duty. They take immense (and not unwarranted) pride in their skills and knowledge, and will take any chance possible to avail those nearby with their achievements.

#### Bronze Dragonflight
The bronze dragonflight was charged not over earth or magic, or any tangible thing; rather, they were charged to ensure that time passes as it should, that the future goes unaltered and that the past stays past. To this end, they were granted power over time itself, able to travel through the endless Caverns of Time to catch and halt those who would seek to change the past.

Due to their wide perspective and confusing travel between times, the bronzes are known to be extremely distant and out of tune with current events; indeed, they consider direct intervention to be only for the utmost of emergencies. Because of this, they are arguably the rarest seen of all dragons, although it is sometimes claimed that they are the most common users of mortal disguise.

#### Green Dragonflight
Ethereal and distant, the green dragonflight was charged with a role inextricably linked to all the others, but inevitably distinct; they and their leader were charged to watch over the Emerald Dream, and to uphold the life and soul of nature across Azeroth. Ever-sleeping, the emerald dragons have all but abandoned their worldly bodies that their spirits may watch over the Emerald Dream, the pristine and mystical mirror of the material world.  It is said that the greens may perceive both these realities at once, interwoven with one another.

Invariably kind spirited and gentle, these dragons will help those who seek to defend Azeroth whenever they can, though their means to do so on the material world are limited.

#### Red Dragonflight
Caring and gentle, though potentially fearsome and protective, the Red Dragonflight were charged to represent life itself in all its forms, but mortal life most of all. to them, all mortal creatures are like children to be protected, and the reds feel a deep obligation to see that the world's history progresses in such a way, though war and death will happen, that mortals are yet able to live and die as mortals, rather than as food to global threats, or fodder to cruel invasions.

Subsequently the red tend to be quite hands-off, preferring to interact with mortals - should they have to - in disguise, seeing that things are progressing smoothly. By preference, however, the ruby dragons will simply bide and live, keeping an eye open for greater threats, but otherwise content to let the world tick on as it should.

### Black Dragonflight
*"My blessing upon you will seem humble compared to those which have been bestowed upon the others: the managing of time, of life, of dreams and magic. I offer you the earth. The soil, the ground, the deep places. But know that the earth is the basis of all things. It is where we are rooted. Where you must come from, if you are to go to. Here is whence true strength comes. From deep places... within the world, and within oneself."*

<div style="text-align:Right">

*— Khaz'goroth's blessing of the Black Aspect*

</div>

<div style='margin-top:20px;'></div>

*"Silence! If you insist on calling it a gift, so be it. Know then what it is to be me, to be given this gracious gift... to feel the fiery heart of this world as your own. Know what it is to feel the weight of this dying world on your shoulders. Does the gift taste as sweet as you thought it would? This is what the other Aspects wish: to chain you to this world as I have been. To damn you to a life of eternal torment."*

<div style="text-align:Right">

*— The Black Aspect, Deathwing*

</div>

Black scales, the deepest colors of onyx and ebony; eyes that burn red with the flame within, and a similar crimson glow visible deep within their throat when they give a mighty roar; black dragons are a sight to behold. Charged with the protection of the earth, and bearers of its strength, the black dragonflight is one of great power.

***Defenders of Azeroth.*** For a time, black dragons were once defenders of Azeroth. They shaped the lands, created mountains and valleys, and represented the strength of the earth. For millennia they defended Azeroth from destruction, until they fell from grace.

***Corrupted Champions.*** At an unknown point, whisperings of the Old Gods corrupted the black dragons, especially their Aspect and leader, Neltharion. During the War of the Ancients, Neltharion was instrumental in the creation of the Dragon Soul; this was ostensibly to defeat the Burning Legion, but Neltharion used it to betray his allies.

With the Legion all but defeated, Neltharion turned the Dragon Soul on the night elves and dragons who had been his allies. Only the timely arrival of Korialstrasz, consort of the red dragonqueen, saved them all from certain death.

***Enemies of Azeroth.*** The betrayal was so great that the other dragonflights never truly recovered, and the ensuing war between dragons further damaged the species. Black dragons were hunted down and nearly annihilated, their numbers reduced to very few. From that point forward they served as infrequent but deadly threats to all.

During much of this time, Neltharion — now called Deathwing — was rarely seen. After a series of setbacks and a defeat at the hands of the other Aspects, he retreated to Deepholm in the Elemental Plane. Many thought he was defeated forever, but they were very wrong.

***Cataclysmic Threat.*** After the fall of the Lich King, Deathwing made his return. He fractured the World Pillar, which caused the Cataclysm and reshaped much of the surface of Azeroth. He and the black dragonflight brought the world to its knees, but were ultimately defeated by brave heroes. At their side fought Wrathion, an uncorrupted black dragonwhelp who represented hope for the future.

### Black Dragon Lairs
Black dragons lair in caves and caverns near volcanic activity, such as hot springs or magma veins. 

[Obsidian Dragonshrine, volcanoes.]

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
- Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If any of the effect's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.
- The dragon causes up to six corpses within the lair to rise as skeletons, zombies, or ghouls. These undead obey its telepathic commands, which can reach anywhere in the lair. 
- Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads a round corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.

#### Regional Effects
The region containing a legendary black dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
- Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted by sulfur.
- Magma rises close to the surface, often spilling out of cracks in a 1 mile radius of the lair.
- Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.

### Blue Dragonflight

*"I believe that you will find that my gift to you is not just a profound duty — which it is — but also a delight — which it is! Magic must be regulated, managed, and controlled. But it must also be appreciated and valued and not hoarded. Such is the contradiction you must deal with. May you be dutiful... and joyous both."*

<div style="text-align:Right">

— *Norgannon's blessing of the Blue Aspect*

</div>

Wreathed in swirls and eddies of snow-dusted air, blue dragons are covered in lustrous scales of azure blue and silvery white. The air around them is often cold. Magic is the domain of the blue dragonflight; they are charged with its use and care, for the power of magic is not to be taken lightly.

***Tending the Arcane.*** Led by the Aspect Malygos, and his mate Sindragosa, the blue dragonflight tended arcane magic for millennia. Native to the northern reaches that would one day become Northrend, they conducted many experiments. They even discovered other realms of existence, and spent much time watching over those who practiced magic.

***Betrayal and Death.*** During the War of the Ancients, the blue dragonflight was betrayed. When Deathwing used the Dragon Soul to turn on his allies, he all but wiped out the blue dragons. Malygos — overwhelmed by the loss of his mate, his friend Neltharion, and most of his kin — fell into a grief-stricken madness. The few blue dragons who remained, and a few remaining blue dragon eggs, were the flight's only hope for the future.

<div style='margin-top:30px;'></div>

    ***The Nexus War.*** Some while after the defeat of Illidan, Malygos seemed to wake from his madness. He concluded that the mortal races had caused too much destruction with their reckless pursuit of power. He and the newly resurgent blue flight declared war on the Kirin Tor and began to siphon the magic of Azeroth, so that it could not be misused, but this had destructive effects on the world. Their efforts became so destructive that Alexstrsza and the other aspects saw no other course but to destroy Malygos.

***Spread to the Winds.*** No other dragonflight at that time had ever suffered the death of an Aspect. Leaderless, and without the guiding power of the Aspect in whom had been placed the power over arcane magic, the blue dragonflight was devastated once again. With the final destruction of Deathwing, this became a moot point, as the Aspects lost their immortality and much of their power.

Their numbers reduced yet again, lacking an Aspect, the blue dragonflight effectively dissolved. Blue dragons went their own way, each choosing their home and their goals as they saw fit. Most retained the dragonkin that were already in their service, but kept little contact with one another.

### Blue Dragon Lairs
[Azure Dragonshrine, the Nexus, ley line confluences.]

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
- The dragon rolls a d8 and regains an expended innate spell of that level or lower. If it has no spent spells of that level or lower, nothing happens.
- The dragon targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. An *antimagic field* fills the space of the target, moving with it until initiative count 20 on the next round.

#### Regional Effects
The region containing a legendary blue dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
- Blue crystals of mana form along the ground near ley lines within 1 mile of the lair. Creatures of mana, such as mana wyrms and arcane elementals, can manifest nearby.
- The dragon is assumed to have a body part of any creature within 1 mile of its lair for the purposes of scrying.
- Wisps of glittering energy float through the air and blue-glowing runes appear on surfaces within 1 mile of the dragon’s lair.

### Bronze Dragonflight
*"Unto you is charged the great task of keeping the purity of time. Know that there is only one true timeline, though there are those who would have it otherwise. You must protect it. Without the truth of time as it is meant to unfold, more will be lost than you can possibly imagine. The fabric of reality will unravel. It is a heavy task — the base of all tasks of this world, for nothing can transpire without time."*

<div style="text-align:Right">

— *Aman'Thul's blessing of the Bronze Aspect*

</div>

Adorned in scales of glimmering bronze, which often seem to shimmer like a mirage in the desert heat, bronze dragons are a majestic sight to behold. Massive wings blot out the sun, their eyes burn with magical intensity, and one has a sense of impending time in their presence. Encountering a bronze dragon is very rare, and always portends great events.

***Guardians of Time.*** Bronze dragons were gifted — and burdened — with power over the passage of time. They were able to see the past and the future with perfect clarity, and in so doing they could identify any unnatural branches from the established timeline. When great powers threatened to change the past to their benefit, or alter the course of events for a future that could be controlled, bronze dragons were there to thwart those plans. They performed their duty with diligence and honor for an Age, until Neltharion's betrayal of dragonkind.

***Hunted to All Corners.*** After Deathwing betrayed his own kind, he attempted to subjugate the bronze dragonflight. This would not come to pass, as Nozdormu — the Timeless One, Aspect of the bronze dragonflight — saw to it that his kin scattered to the distant corners of Azeroth. From there, they maintained their endless vigil over the proper timeline.

***War in the Desert.*** Though bronze dragons are not often likely to become involved in mortal affairs, they became embroiled in the War of the Shifting Sands, over a thousand years ago. Initially unwilling to help the night elves battle the Qiraji, their attitude changed when the spreading conflict threatened the Caverns of Time. Nozdormu and his kin joined in the fight, and even enlisted the aid of the other major dragonflights. After locking the danger away in Ahn'Qiraj, they returned to their seclusion.

***Destroying the Dragon Soul.*** They joined mortal affairs again during the Second War, specifically the Battle of Grim Batol. When faced with Deathwing and his minions once again, Nozdormo was finally convinced to throw the bronze dragonflight into the conflict. Along with the other dragons, they saw the destruction of the Dragon Soul which locked away some of the Aspects' power, and forced Deathwing into retreat once again. With Nozdormu restored to his former strength, he and the bronze dragons once again took a more active role in the world.

***Loss of the Sight.*** After the Cataclysm, when dragons gathered to battle Deathwing one final time, the bronze dragonflight was not absent. They took their place in Wyrmrest Accord and joined in the fight, but with the destruction of Deathwing and the fulfillment of the Aspects' purpose, much was lost. Nozdormu and the other bronze dragons retained much of their power, but lost their sight of the true timeline, as well as direct control over it.

### Bronze Dragon Lairs
[Bronze Dragonshrine, Caverns of Time.]

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- The dragon glimpses the future, so it has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until initiative count 20 on the next round.
- A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- The flow of time is altered such that every creature in the lair must reroll initiative. The dragon can choose not to reroll.

#### Regional Effects
The region containing a legendary bronze dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
- Within 3 miles of the dragon’s lair, shimmering mirages can be seen in the distance, showing reflections of other locations at other points in time, such as immense cities and primeval forests.
- Tracks of previous travellers through the region can occasionally be seen, as though they were freshly placed, regardless of how long ago their owners passed through. Other tracks disappear almost moments after being placed. Those that lead to the dragon’s lair are never to be found.
- Creatures within 6 miles of the lair regularly get a feeling of deja vu.

### Green Dragonflight

*"You are bound to the waking Dream of Creation. Nature is your realm, and all things have caught glimpses of the Emerald Dream when they sleep. You see them all, Ysera. And they see you, though they may not know it. Like the Life-Binder, you touch all living beings, and sing to them the songs of creation and interconnectedness."*

<div style="text-align:Right">

— *Eonar's blessing of the Green Aspect*

</div>

The green dragonflight consists of dragons adorned with vibrant, green scales -- earning them their second moniker as the *Emerald Dragonflight*. 

During the ordering of Azeroth, the titan Eonar charged Ysera and her flight with upholding the natural balance of both Azeroth and the Emerald Dream; a pristine spirit-realm of nature and magic that exists far beyond the boundaries of the physical world. It is through this charge that the green dragons keep their affinity for the wilds.

***Protectors of Nature.*** When dealing with mortals, green dragons primarily only come into conflict with those who would attempt to corrupt or destroy nature. In this sense, much like the red dragons, they are among the most approachable of the dragonflights. To this end, they have many a time sought the help of druids to aid in their task, and to this day keep a close connection with such groups -- the Cenarion Circle in particular.

***Solitary Lives.*** Given the task placed upon them and their ties to the Emerald Dream, it is not surprising that green dragons highly reclusive; exceedingly difficult for mere mortals to find on their own. They are peaceful, meditative, and said to be spending most of their time in slumber and quiet contemplation. 

\columnbreak

***Seeding the Great Trees.*** Following the Great Sundering at the end of the War of the Ancients, the green Dragon Aspect Ysera played part in seeding a colossal tree within the new Well of Eternity. The tree became known as Nordrassil, the Crown of the Heavens -- and with its branches as saplings, several more trees were scattered across Azeroth. 

These were the Great Trees, five of them in total. They were not planted with Ysera's approval, however, nor did they receive her blessing as Nordrassil once had. And so, as the trees came to tower over the lands, their roots dug deep, one tree fell an ill fate. In Northrend, the great tree Andrassil had reached deep enough into the earth to touch the subterranean prison of Yogg'saron. 

***The Seeping Nightmare.*** As Yogg'saron touched the roots of Andrassil, without the dragons' protection, corruption quickly seeped into the tree. Though it was a heartbreaking task for the druids of the Cenarion Circle, the tree was destroyed -- renamed Vordrassil, the Broken Crown -- and the corruption thought stopped. 

The Great Trees would all act as portals; each one an anchoring point for the druids and green dragons alike to travel between Azeroth and the Emerald Dream, as well as a grove under the dragonflight's protection. 

Unknown to them all, however, was the darkness that had already taken root within the Emerald Dream. Yogg'saron, and the other Old Gods with it, used the Great Trees to allow their influence to reach beyond the mortal world. Heralded by a corrupting mist that spread out across the land, and by its eponymous Nightmare Lord, swathes of the Dream were twisted beyond any resemblance of its verdant self and corrupted into a waking Nightmare.

### Green Dragon Lairs
[Green Dragonshrine, ???.]

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.
- One creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a dream plane, a different plane of existence the dragon has imagined into being. To escape, the creature must use its action to make a Charisma check contested by the dragon's. If the creature wins, it escapes the dream plane. Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count 20 on the next round. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied.
- The dragon creates fog as though it had cast the *fog cloud* spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.

#### Regional Effects
The region containing a legendary green dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
- The flora within 1 mile can sometimes come to life, turning into lashers and other similar creatures.
- When attempting to stay awake through a long rest, such as keeping watch, creatures within 3 miles of the dragon's lair must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw each hour or fall asleep.
- Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon's lair serve as the dragon's eyes and ears.
- The air within 3 miles of the dragon’s lair is misty and dim. Creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on sight for distances greater than 60 feet. When attempting to leave the area, this effect seems to fade.

### Red Dragonflight

*"This is my gift: compassion for all living things. A drive to protect and nurture them. And the ability to heal that which others cannot, birth what others may not, and love even the unlovable -- who surely need such grace more than any other souls."*

<div style="text-align:Right">

— *Eonar's blessing of the Green Aspect*

</div>

Borne across the sky on ruby wings, the red dragonflight are feared and revered for their fiery breath -- which has been gifted the power both to bring life and to take it away. They are led by Alexstrasza, the Life-Binder, whose duty was given to her by the titan Eonar. 

***Protectors of Life.*** It is not without reason that the red dragonflight consider themselves custodians of mortal life. In many ways, their claim is true; for they are often the chosen wardens of places and artifacts whose powers might spell doom for lesser beings. Wherever a red dragon walks or breathes upon the earth, its soil is renewed, lush and vibrant with life.

***Mortal Ambassadors.*** With the exception of the green dragonflight's ties to the druids of the Cenarion Circle, if a mortal were to encounter a dragon -- whether knowingly or not -- it's most likely that dragon would hail from the red dragonflight. It is common among all dragons to keep tabs on mortal races, especially their sprawling cities and important figures, none of the other flights would do so as openly as the red dragonflight often has.

***The Queen of Dragons.*** Perhaps even greater than her role as the Life-Binder, Alexstrasza of the red dragonflight also holds the title of Dragon Queen. She, along with her consorts, receives the greatest reverence even among the other dragonflights, and her compassion for the mortal races of Azeroth is beyond equal. 

It is her firmly held belief that only a few are ever truly evil, and that even those who are may not yet be beyond redemption. After all, the power to change and to grow is inherent in all life, whether it chooses to seek light or steep itself in darkness. 

***The Dragons and the Dragonmaw.*** During the Second War, the orc shaman Zuluhed of the Dragonmaw clan received visions of a powerful artifact hidden away within the depths of the earth -- the Dragon Soul. In the hands of Zuluhed's lieutenant, Nekros Skullcrusher, the Dragonmaw clan wielded the power of the Dragon Soul to track down and enslave scores of the red dragonflight; including the Life-Binder Alexstrasza herself.

For eight agonizing years, the Queen of Dragons was kept prisoner by the Dragonmaw clan, deep within the halls of Grim Batol; an ancient and abandoned dwarven fortress the orcs had seized as their base of operations. There, the orcish Horde raised her offspring as devastating weapons of war for their swelling ranks of dragon riders. 

***The Battle of Grim Batol.*** Even after the defeat of the Horde at the end of the Second War, the Dragonmaw clan remained undefeated at Grim Batol and Alexstrasza remained their prisoner. It was then that a small band of resistance fighters from the Alliance -- led by the human mage Rhonin -- managed to infiltrate the ancient fortress in an effort to free the Dragon Queen. 

A great battle ensued; one in which the Aspects clashed with the fallen Earth-Warder, before the Dragon Soul was shattered and the orcs routed. Once the dragons could take wing again, they returned to their old charge as protectors, though their wounds would take a long time to heal.

### Red Dragon Lairs
[Red Dragonshrine, ???.]

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Each creature of the dragon's choice within 60 feet of the dragon gains the benefits of the *haste* spell until initiative count 20. At the beginning of their turn, they take fire damage equal to their number of hit dice. This damage ignores fire resistance and immunity.

#### Regional Effects
The region containing a legendary red dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

### Lesser Dragonflights
Outside of the five greater dragonflights exists a number of outliers; all true dragons, with all the vast power and intellect that implies, but each of them outside of the charge of the Titans that has long empowered them.

These lesser dragonflights are all connected in some way to the five true flights, but each is distinct and unique in their own regard, eking out a place in the world that separates them from the true dragonflights. For better or worse, these lesser dragonflights are races unto themselves, and can be as if not more dangerous than the prime dragonflights.
 
#### Infinite Dragonflight
Appearing as invasive forces throughout the timeways as twisted inverses of the bronze dragonflight, the mysterious infinite dragonflight appear to their bronze foes as insane and extremely dangerous terrorists threatening the flows of history itself.

The infinite flight traverse history, appearing through hijacked timeways at important moments in history to disrupt and change the passage of time, seeking to avert some distant future that they consider unfavourable. Their origin is unknown, as are their motivations or base of operations; all that is known is that they are a threat to all of time, and the enemy to all life.

***The Infinite Aspect.*** Seemingly equal in power to the five true Dragon Aspects is the mysterious, unseen leader of the infinite flight. From a distant, broken, locked future timeline, this dragon of immense power directs the rest of their flight to influence past events with zealous fervour, as though desperate to change the future.
 
#### Netherwing Dragonflight
The netherwing dragonflight were born from black dragon eggs brought by Deathwing onto the orc homeworld Draenor -- shortly before it was destroyed. As the calamity tore the planet asunder, the volatile powers of the Twisting Nether saw the eggs hatch into shimmering, translucent beings; half there, half not.

Now fairly numerous, these world-weary dragons have lived hard lives since Outland's collapse, facing threats of enslavement or extinction at the hands of orcs and demons, before seeing their rapid lives burn out like too-bright stars in the dim sky. Like much else in Outland, they live lives of tragedy; nasty, brutish and short lives marred by the irony of their own creation, as dragons that were meant to be stockpiles of black eggs, and ended up being close to nothing at all.

They are wary of the world around them, and mistrusting of strangers, but the bonds they create with the few mortals they trust are eternal, and forged by dragonfire; for although they are composed of wild energy, dragons they are, and they are pleased to be recognized as such.

<div style='margin-top:30px;'></div>

#### Twilight Dragonflight
The culmination of years of study and experimentation by the consort to Deathwing, Sintharia, the twilight flight was crafted from the blood of all flights for one purpose alone; they are superweapons, vitriolic masses of unstable energy in dragon form that are able to release overwhelming power upon the foes of their masters, the black dragonflight. Their very existence is chaos, their bodies radiating the same twisted energies that saw their creation as they shift back and forth between the material world and a harrowing plane of existence known as the Realm of Twilight.

The greatest danger in encountering these creatures is their uncontrollable nature. Though they are loyal to Deathwing, they are prone to cowardice, outbursts and mockery when placed in the command of anyone else. This, combined with the extremely unstable nature of their bodies, makes being around one a dangerous risk even for allies. When they die, and even sometimes when they do not, their bodies are known to suddenly and violently explode with life-extinguishing energy, taking with them a sizeable chunk of the environment.

> ##### Chromatic Dragonflight
> One of Nefarion's earliest experiments was attempting to condense the powers of the five greater dragonflights into a single creation, to be known as the chromatic dragonflight. These experiments were largely considered failures; many whelps died before hatching, and those that survived were unstable, short-lived, volatile, and/or deformed. One of the very few successes of these experiments was the drakeadon, a semi-draconic beast.

### Infinite Dragonflight
*"The "End Time," I once called this place. I had not seen, by then; I did not know. You hope to... what? Stop me, here? Change the fate I worked so tirelessly to weave? You crawl unwitting, like a blind, writhing worm, towards endless madness and despair. I have witnessed the true End Time. This? This is a blessing you simply cannot comprehend."*

<div style="text-align:Right">

*- Murozond the Infinite*

</div>

The cruel and enigmatic Infinite Dragonflight are the inverse of the wise Bronze flight. Where the Bronze seek <br/> to maintain the flow of time and ensure that past events remain as they are, while trying to learn from their glimpses of the future, the Infinite flight seek to disrupt and change the course of history, appearing amongst major events from times past and altering them through trickery or brute force. Their motivations are cloudy, and their origins are a secret hidden in the ages past - or in the distant future.

***Negative Image.*** They appear as eye-watering negatives of their bronze foes, their colors and bodies altered by their drastic meddling with the timeflow, with scales in metallic greys and blues. Their hides appear cracked and bleed out glowing energy instead of blood. Their voices almost seem to come from all directions, and echo in a disjointed manner, and when they move they almost seem to be unsynchronised with events around them - their shadows may lag behind for a moment, or their breath attack may scorch the earth before the flames touch it.

***Time Bandits.***  The Infinites have only one apparent <br/> goal - changing the outcomes of major historical events to change the future. To do so they aggressively create tears in time, before using disguise and  subterfuge to subtly change events. They may mislead a major leader, assassinate a king, or simply change several minor details and invoke the butterfly effect. When things do not go according to plan, however, they throw subtlety away and engage in all-out dragon combat, uncaring of the consequences across time.

***Ebb and flow.*** In response to these threats, the Bronze Dragonflight have been in a constant state of cat and mouse with the Infinites. Never able to identify their base of operations, with only smatterings of knowledge about their leadership, the Bronze have found that they are unable to do direct interference with the Infinites - partly due to their own nature, but also because the Infinites seem to know everything about the Bronze. Their methods, their weaknesses, their powers - and the Infinites are far less scrupulous with collateral damage. As such, the Bronze must frequently collaborate with adventurers, sending them into the past through the Caverns of Time to prevent catastrophic destruction to the timeline.

***Lost time.*** The origins of the Infinites are unclear. However, among their ranks, some familiar names have been heard. It has been suggested that the Infinites may have once been Bronze dragons who became disillusioned with the duty of their flight, or perhaps who entered the timeways and became lost or confused. Others suggest that the Infinites may be dark reflections of real dragons created from alternative universes, of which thousands are created and destroyed each second. In truth, their origins may remain a mystery as old as time.

> ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The wyrm's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
> 
> At will: *blade ward*, *blur*, *expeditious retreat*, *hold <br/>     person*, *minor illusion*, *misty step*, *protection from <br/>     energy*, *toll the dead* ^XGE^ 
> <br/> 3/day each: *greater invisibility*, *haste*, *slow*
> <br/> 1/day each: *feeblemind*, *true seeing*, *weird*
>
> ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the wyrm fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The wyrm can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claw.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) fire damage.
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.
>
> ***Tail Sweep.*** The wyrm swings its tail, and every creature within 20 feet of it must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.
>
> ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the wyrm's choice that is within 120 feet of the wyrm and aware of it must succeed on a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the wyrm's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
>
> ***Black Sand Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The wyrm exhales sand in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 148 (33d8) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This damage ignores resistance to slashing damage and treats immunity as resistance instead. 
> <br/>   Until the beginning of the drake's next turn, a creature who fails their save has their speed halved, can't make more than one attack on its turn, and can use an action or bonus action but not both.
>
> ***Change Shape.*** The wyrm magically transforms into any humanoid that is Medium or Small, while retaining its game statistics (other than its size). This transformation ends if the dragon is reduced to 0 hit points or uses a bonus action to end it.
>
> ### Legendary Actions
> The wyrm can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The wyrm regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
>
> **Temporal Flicker.** The wyrm teleports to an 
<br/>    unoccupied space it can see within 40 feet.
> <br/> **Glimpse the Future.** The wyrm has advantage on its 
<br/>    next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.
> <br/> **Reverse Time (Costs 2 Actions).** A creature within 
<br/>    80 feet that the wyrm can see must make a DC 23 
<br/>    Charisma save. On a failure, they are teleported to 
<br/>    the space where they were in the start of their turn. 
<br/>    In addition, they have disadvantage in their next 
<br/>    attack.
> <br/> **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The wyrm beats its 
<br/>    wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the wyrm 
<br/>    must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or 
<br/>    take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be 
<br/>    knocked prone. The wyrm can then fly up to half its 
<br/>    flying speed.
> <br/> **Breath Weapon (Costs 3 Actions).** The wyrm uses its 
<br/>    breath weapon, if it is available.

### Infinite Dragon Lairs
[Bronze lairs are infinite lairs.]

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- The effects of time are altered such that every creature in the lair must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become 1d20 years older or younger (the dragon's choice), but never any younger than 1 year old. A *greater restoration* spell can restore a creature's age to normal.
- Each creature within 30 feet of the dragon must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be affected by corrupted time, rolling 1d4 times on the Corrupted Time table below.

##### Corrupted Time
d6| Result
--|------
1 | **Rewind Time.** The target regains hit points equal to its total number of hit dice.
2 | **Time Lapse.** On its next turn, the target's speed is halved and cannot use its action.
3 | **Temporal Daze.** On its next turn, the target cannot take any action or bonus action and uses all of its movement to move in a random direction. 
4 | **Temporal Shift.** The target teleports to a random position within 30 feet.
5 | **Time Warp.** Until the drake's next turn, the target's speed is doubled, attacks against it have advantage and it cannot maintain concentration.
6 | **Unravel Time.** The target takes psychic damage equal to its total number of hit dice.

#### Regional Effects
The region containing a legendary bronze dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
- Within 3 miles of the dragon’s lair, shimmering mirages can be seen in the distance, showing reflections of other locations at other points in time, such as immense cities and primeval forests.
- Tracks of previous travellers through the region can occasionally be seen, as though they were freshly placed, regardless of how long ago their owners passed through. Other tracks disappear almost moments after being placed. Those that lead to the dragon’s lair are never to be found.
- Creatures within 6 miles of the lair regularly get a feeling of deja vu.

### Netherwing Dragonflight

*"You were once a chief lieutenant, Mor'ghor. Your work in Grim Batol is not easily forgotten. Now... We need the eggs that you recovered. The Netherwing eggs. They are, after all, a product of the master. We will pay whatever price that you ask."*

<div style="text-align:Right">

*- Sintharia*

</div>

The Netherwing Dragonflight live in the shadow of many sordid events. Spawned of the Black Dragonflight as eggs laid by Deathwing's own consort, they were cursed before they even hatched when they were hidden by their father on Draenor - shortly before the orc homeworld's destruction. As a result of the twisting shadowy energy upon their embryonic bodies, upon hatching they were found to be a new creature entirely; one that exists in a state of unreality, half there and half not.

Deep purples, blues and greens - the colours of the  Twisting Nether - emblazon Netherwing populations, their translucent bodies and shadowy skin seeming smooth and flush. Their faces are more like that of a shark than a reptile. They are of few words, what little they say tends to be sombre. 

Living in the nether-torn reaches of Outland, the Netherwing Flight have propagated and forged a life for themselves, facing off threats at every angle, from slavery to extinction, while being forced to accept the facts of their own half-existence.

***Nether born.*** Hatched in the swirling energies of a dying planet, the Netherwing dragons can be said to be only half-real. Creatures fighting them may find that their attacks simply phase through the dragons' bodies. Their very presence will burn away at the very being of anybody unfortunate enough to be near them, and their very breath is formed of the arcane energies of the Twisting Nether. Due to the instability of their bodies, they grow into adult hood rapidly, and then burn their lives away at extreme speed, fading away like dying stars. 

***Dragonmaw mounts.*** The remnants of the unscrupulous Dragonmaw Claon in Outland have a history of capturing, enslaving and breaking dragons into beasts of war, and as the only dragons native to Outland, the Netherwing are no different. Bound in the name of Illidan Stormrage, the dragons faced a choice of enslavement or death. 

***Dark energies.*** The magic within their bodies and their eggs is considered valuable by those interested in such things, and the devious methods that utilise this magic never result in a living Nether dragon. The corruptive power within their unstable bodies has been seen to alter and transform those flooded with it, while their eggs have been used as a stepping stone in the creation of even darker species.

> **Decrepify.** A creature within 60 feet that the wyrm can 
<br/>    see must make a DC 23 Dexterity save. On a failure, 
<br/>    their movement speed is reduced to 0 feet until the 
<br/>    end of the wyrm's next turn.

<br/>    around it, regaining a use of Intangible Presence.

<br/>    Constitution save, taking 14 (4d6) necrotic damage 
<br/>    on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. 
<br/>    The dragon regains hit points equal to the necrotic 
<br/>    damage dealt.
> <br/> **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The wyrm beats its 
<br/>    wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the wyrm 
<br/>    must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or 
<br/>    take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be 
<br/>    knocked prone. The wyrm can then fly up to half its 
<br/>    flying speed.

<br/>    breath weapon, if it is available.

### Twilight Dragonflight

*"I am the beginning of the end...the shadow which blots out the sun...the bell which tolls your doom. For this moment ALONE was I made. Look upon your death, mortals, and despair!"* 

<div style="text-align:Right">

*- Ultraxion*

</div>

Into the Twilight Dragonflight, the black dragon Aspect Deathwing placed all of his hatred and seething desire to see life put to an end. Into their bodies he placed the atrophic power of pure destruction, the power sufficient to end all life. Into their minds he placed only anger and jealousy, mixed with pride enough to eclipse any other. In the Twilight flight Deathwing had his perfect weapons.

Their deep purple bodies, at times semi-translucent, pulse and hum with overwhelming amounts of energy. Their extremely unstable forms fluctuate, and their mere presence warps and alters magic around them.  Though physically powerful, their true strength is in their powers over their twilight magic, able to tap into a mysterious Twilight Realm to facilitate their unmaking of their master's foes.

***Experiments Completed.*** Through his children and mate's failed work creating the Netherwing and Chromatic dragons, Deathwing saw the path to success in his grand plan - a race of dragonkin subservient to him that exist only to destroy. A symbol of his future dominion over dragonkind, and weapon to bring it to fruition. To Deathwing, his family's failures made them less than nothing - the Twilight Flight was his success, and his alone.

***Unstable Horrors.*** Twilight dragons are extremely unstable, being flooded with considerably more energy than their bodies can handle. It is common for weakened Twilight dragons to spontaneously explode, causing significant destruction even in death. Even when intact, their bodies constantly arc out with devastating energy, which can ground itself on unfortunate adventurers unfortunate enough to act as a conduit. 

***Twilight Realm.*** The dragons of this flight are able to tap into, and even transport themselves to, a mysterious place they call the Twilight Realm. Nothing is known of this place other than that no light enters it. There is no sun in the sky, no flames to light the way, and no hope for any mortal trapped within.

***Displaced loyalty.*** The twilight dragons are fully and exclusively loyal to Deathwing, and when made to ally themselves with others of Deathwing's servants, they make clear their distaste in no small amount. It is rare that a grown twilight dragon of any renown would ever consider dying to save another, unless expected to by Deathwing himself.

## Elementals
Elementals are ageless, ever-changing spirits of the primal forces that forge worlds; volatile beings of raw elemental power, manifested in physical form. The most common primordial form of life has been these elementals, who come before any organic life is ever able to be born, and will persist long after all organic life has perished.

***Base Primal Forces.*** The elements are a complex hotbed of different forces and interactions, but for the most part, four primary materials are manifested. These are, of course, fire, water, earth and air; the building blocks of the world. 

***Spiritual Conflict.*** The fifth element is said to be spirit, the inner energy of all living beings. Worlds with strong spirit are tranquil and manifest few elemental spirits who act in harmony. However, worlds with compromised spirit will result in all-out war that can shatter and recreate the surface of the world multiple times in a day.

Azeroth was one such world, where its four Elemental Lords fought for countless millenia. Mountains, volcanoes, oceans and storms rose and fell rapidly as one lord gained ground over another.

***Bound to the Elemental Plane.*** On Azeroth, as the titanic Keepers saw to the ordering of the world, they found the elementals wreaking havoc under the corrupting influence of the Old Gods. As a safeguard, the Keepers constructed the Elemental Plane as a prison in which the elemental lords could be locked away. In their absence, the Keepers could tend to their task at hand; settling the natural order of Azeroth.

The Elemental Plane is intimately connected to the world of Azeroth, preventing all but the weakest manifestations of elemental power in the world. It is divided into four interlinked realms: the Abyssal Maw, realm of water; Deepholm, realm of earth; the Firelands, realm of fire; and Skywall, realm of air.

***Shamanic Allies.*** Much of the responsibilities of the elements to maintain the balance of the world falls into the hands of the shamans. Shamans commune with them using spiritual magic, borrowing their powers only at the elements' permission. Because of this, shamans are forever devoted to a cycle of favor and thanks, gaining great power in exchange for reverence, loyalty, or whatever other small favors the spirits may seek.

***Elemental Instability.*** Even the Titanic prison cannot fully keep the forces of the world locked away, and any place of major elemental significance is likely to have a few minor elementals roaming around. Ancient springs, deep canyons, and especially volcanoes and powerful storms all may spawn elementals. 

Similarly, skilled spellcasters can summon more powerful elementals directly from their home plane. An elemental spawned this way will be bound in a pair of bracers, necessarily limiting their power and binding them to the command of whoever summoned them.

***Elemental Nature.*** Elementals do not eat, drink or sleep. They do not feel pain, and if they are killed, they will return to their home plane. They will die permanently only if killed while in their home plane.

### Air Elementals
Taking the form of a swirling vortex of air, a collection of clouds and static, or even an almost humanoid amalgam of storm, frost, or dust, the elementals of air command the realm of the sky. Turbulent gales and gentle breezes tell locals the mood of the element of air, while fierce lightning lashes at whomever may have angered them.

***Thunderbolts and Lightning.*** The wrath of storms is among the most catastrophic and impressive shows of pure power within nature. Shamans wielding lightning grasp extraordinary amounts of energy, perhaps more than any other force at their call, and these shamans are careful to wield it with caution.

***The Four Winds.*** The world's winds are categorized among the four cardinal directions: North, East, South, and West. Each wind carries with it a different aspect of the weather. 

The frigid North Wind carries blizzards, sleet storms and cold snaps; while the swelling East Wind brings with it storm force winds, gales, cyclones and hurricanes. The South Wind carries brutal thunderstorms from the sea, crashing lightning, rain, and clinging static; while  with the West Wind comes gentle breezes, carrying the changing of winter to spring, scented with pollen.

#### Skywall
The realm of air, Skywall, takes the form of astonishing white and gold palaces that stretch into a clear sunny sky, seemingly crafted out of the clouds themselves. Ever buffeted by gentle breezes, the towering jeweled archi- tecture possesses few floors or stairways; the chief mode of travel in the realm of air is free flight, a feature every denizen possesses. 

***Elemental Hierarchy.*** Sitting atop the the Throne of the Four Winds is Al'Akir the Windlord. Below him are his four lieutenants - the Conclave of Wind - who act as secondary rulers of each of the four winds. Leadership of the four winds is in flux, changing anytime their political foes decide that their time as lords is over. Al'akir, of course, watches the struggles for power with amusement, firm in the knowledge that his own rule is undisputed.

***Cunning Winds.*** More than the swirling power of the sky, the element of air is most associated with intellect and cunning. Its elemental masters rule the skies with royal authority, manipulating the complex systems of friend and foe within their own realm in much the same way as a mortal government. 

***Subjects of Skywall.*** These elemental creatures range widely, from spectres of the faintest squalls to mighty stormclouds given humanoid shape. Fierce elementals in the shape of Azeroth's dragons, known as storm dragons, guard Skywall's paths and bridges, while the spirits of howling gales threaten to blow smaller entities away. In the finest temples stand the djinn, swirling sultans of the winds, acting out the Windlord’s highest commands.


<!-- Taking form as a swirling storm, or a billowing cloud given faint humanoid shape, an air elemental holds command of wind and weather. Fast and silent, it strikes out by enveloping its foes in a blinding whirlwind to seize the upper hand.

#### Skywall
[Checkmarks for each of the elemental planes for what to cover:]
- What is the government of each plane? Non-specific as to names of current members at first. For example, the Elemental Lord of Skywall is called the Windlord. Below him is the Conclave of Winds, representing the Four Winds. And so on.
- Who populates the realm beyond the elementals? For example, Skywall also has djinn and storm drakes.
- What is the capital and major settlements (those worth knowing about)? 
- What is the appearance of the plane? It's air, water, earth? What is the architectural style of its buildings?
- Finally, cover who the current ruler(s) of the plane are. Both pre- and post- Cataclysm. Specify when they were replaced. -->

### Arcane Elementals
Some entities much like elementals form out of other primordial forces. In the case of places overflowing with arcane power, the energy will manifest arcane elementals, similarly bound by bracers and similarly populated by inscrutable minds that seem to act on the seemingly random nature of the arcane itself.

***A Mage's Best Servant.*** As accumulations of arcane energy, arcane elementals can be crafted and bound into service by powerful mages. It is not uncommon to find numerous lesser elementals being used as simple servants in magical academies and cities such as Silvermoon or Dalaran.

***Arcane Anomalies.*** Arcane elementals are rare anomalies, and are most commonly seen in places suffused with arcane power. This makes them relatively common at the sites of exposed ley lines, the magical channels that flow under the surface of planets like blood vessels. 

***Ley Lines.*** Ley lines are channels of immense arcane power that runs all along the surface of a planet in an interconnected web. They are usually buried deep in the earth, visible only to the eyes of those deeply attuned to magic such as the blue dragonflight. Those that are exposed to the surface usually begin to crystallize in the form of glowing purple mana crystals. They have been used for many things, such as creation of moonwells to powering portal spells. 

Ley lines form and change based on the locations of their nexuses--areas where multiple ley lines cross or spring forth from, usually in areas of magical significance and intense use of magic such as cities with large mage academies, blue dragon nesting grounds, or ancient Titan installations.

> ##### Variant: Arcane Elemental Familiar
> Lesser arcane elementals can sometimes be found in the service of powerful mages, acting as servants and carrying out menial tasks. 
>
> ***Familiar.*** The elemental can be bound into serving another creature as a familiar, forming a telepathic bond with its willing master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the elemental senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the elemental is within 10 feet if its master, the master shares the elemental's Magic Resistance trait. If its master causes it physical harm, the elemental will end its service as a familiar, breaking the telepathic bond.

<!-- Near indistinguishable from rocks if standing still, an earth elemental is as hardy and steadfast as the element it embodies. It burrows through the ground with utmost <br/> ease, and faces its opponents head-on if engaged. -->

Rumbling boulders, coated in moss or baked red in the sun, pull together as though attracted by gravity. They form the vaguest shape of a torso, misshapen from its rocky components, which begin to gently orbit one another. Tiny pinprick eyes observe the world around it, and do so for hours. What is it thinking as the world goes by?

***Strength and Stability.*** The power of the earth is slow yet strong. Despite this quiet strength, no other element is able to cause as much change to the world. Mountains alter weather patterns and deny the movements of living beings merely by their presence, while an earthquake can wipe a city that has lasted a hundred years off the map in mere moments.

***The Everpatient Mountain.*** The element of earth has personalities that can embody aspects of the earth such as the intimidating power of mountains or the potential motion of earthquakes and avalanches. Most commonly however, earth is the element of fortitude, patience and steadfastness. While their strength stems from this, it often comes with a weakness in an unwillingness to act, exer&shy;cising extreme caution in all decisions.

#### Deepholm
Deepholm, Azeroth’s plane of earth, is a vast, seemingly endless network of gigantic caverns, winding tunnels and quicksilver lakes. What little that is organic must live without sunlight, for only the dim glow of crystal growths and arcing energy provides illumination. Crystals grow slowly out of ancient structures built for feet that will never walk them, and throughout the realm rocks, islands and tiny articulates drift gently in the air, uninterested in gravity’s distractions.

***Elemental Hierarchy.*** The ruler of Deepholme has always been Therazane the Stonemother. Below her are her sons, the immense stone colossi known as the Stone Lords, each embodying a different aspect of the earth in both appearance and personality. While whether or not the Stone Lords are the actual sons of the Stonemother is unknown, their familial bonds result in a very stable system of governance for the earthen plane.

***Sanctuary of the Black.*** The black dragonflight, with their connection to the earth and deep places of the world, have been a semi-regular sight in these dark caverns. Deathwing has used the domain of the Stonemother as a sanctuary several times over the last few millenia, recuperating in the powerful energies of the Stonecore after failed clashes with the forces of Azeroth.

***Holding Up the World.*** In the center of Deepholm, in the immense Temple of Earth, resides the World Pillar. This artifact of the Titans is the keystone that bears the weight of all the elemental and magnetic forces in the Elemental Plane. Without it, Deepholm and by extension the rest of the plane would collapse into Azeroth, causing untold destruction to both the elementals and the planet. Deathwing's shattering of the stone when he escaped the plane during the Cataclysm has earned the entire black dragonflight the eternal emnity of the earth elementals.

***Denizens of Deepholm.*** Earthen spirits come in many forms, in various combinations of rock, crystal, or metal. When the earth is threatened, it will spawn worms of crushing crystal teeth, geode giants coated in shining opals, furious storms of dust, metal-skinned animals, earthen warriors and even stone in the shape of dragons.

### Fel Elemental
<!-- A solid mass of green flame, these elementals are composed of pure fel energy. Their chaotic nature fuels their eternal rage, which in turn allows them to burn through almost anything. Largely unthinking, these creatures usually spontaneously form in areas of extreme fel corruption. -->

On planets devastated by the invasion of demons, the very elements will invariably be poisoned by the cancerous magic of demonkind known as the Fel. Manifesting as a sick green flame that fuels itself with the life force of others, the Fel is the very definition of unnatural. In places where the Fel is exceptionally soaked into the elements, it may take form as a mindless elemental of green flame and extreme aggression, a sinful combination of creation and unmaking given shape.

***Fel Cores.*** The infernal core of a Fel elemental is a disgusting thing, something like a pulsing heart of pure corruption. These cores are a vital part of demonic magic, as they are used to power many of their mechanical or magical constructs. Fel forges are fueled by malformed elemental coals, and demon weapons are crafted from ores deeply infused with the Fel. 

***Terror Forming.*** The corruption of worlds that spawns these parodies of elemental life is a major step in any large-scale invasion by the Burning Legion. Their corruption of the land and poisoning of the air serves many purposes; it helps the demons acclimate, making the place more to their liking, while harming and demoralizing their enemies. 

It also benefits the Burning Legion by warping natural resources to suit their needs, creating fel iron ores and brutish, corrupted wildlife that feeds their armies. The end result is a burnt-out, black wasteland colored only by neon green embers and lava, covered by layers of smog so thick that no life may remain.

***Beasts of Rage.*** The fel energies that make up these elementals burns away any shred of sapience they might have once possessed, leaving them nearly rabid. This anger fuels their flames, allowing their fires to burn hot enough to singe even true flame elementals. Only the greatest of their number regain any sense of true intellect and even then only in the form of a bestial cunning.

### Fire Elementals
<!-- A fire elemental manifests as a smoldering pillar of unwavering destruction. While susceptible to water, it is a cunning presence that will often attempt to overwhelm and outright engulf those who try to stand in its way. -->

A cruel-eyed face staring out of a body like the smoldering of a furnace freed of its constraints. Overwhelming heat crisps the ground around it, and shimmers the air, even as a fire elemental reaches out, eager to spread the flames of its never-ending rage.

***Burning Passion.*** Fire is, in a word, the element of passion. This is a two-sided coin, as spirits of fire are as vulnerable to extreme fits of blinding rage as they are to good humour, though the former is far more common. They are creatures of immediate need, representing both the burning heat that forged the world and the joy and anger of consciousness.

***Fiery Gifts.*** More than any other element, the realm of fire has involved itself in the affairs of mortals. This ranges from simple matters such as fire elementals taking part in Summer festivals, to things as complex as whole mountain ranges being ruled by powerful fire lords, or mutations of mortal races into fire elementals. 

#### The Firelands
A simple name to elucidate the core of a place; the plane of fire is an endless sky of burning, blazing smog, filled with small islands of volcanic rock. The intense heat is enough to set ablaze anything not of the realm, and water is a thing of fantasy. Rivers of molten lava split the dry rock, while irregular igneous rock grows and cools into grand shapes, ever changing the landscape.

***Elemental Hierarchy.*** Ruling from the Sulfuron Keep is Ragnaros the Firelord, with the second in command being his Majordomo. Below them are the various Lords and Barons of the Firelands. A lord's rank is determined by his martial prowess, as to gain and hold your position you must be capable of defeating all who would contest your power.

***Lords of Cinder.*** The Firelands are a militant place, kept under a strict hierarchy of command with ascension in rank coming exclusively through rite of succession; the fiery lieutenants of the Firelord have for eons remained in charge by holding off competitors at every turn. There is no subtlety in the Firelands, and combat is determined quickly, and to the bitter end, inevitably resulting in a group of lords that is both ancient, and unrelenting.

***Ruler of Blackrock.*** Long ago, Ragnaros was summoned by the Dark Iron dwarves as part of their war against their Bronzebeard and Wildhammer kinsmen. His arrival shattered the Redridge Mountains, created the Burning Steppes and Searing Gorge, and turned Blackrock Mountain into an active volcano. The surviving Dark Iron dwarves were enslaved by the Firelord and his lieutenants, acting as his tools for hundreds of years while he gathered his strength in the Molten Core, awaiting the time he could burn all of Azeroth to ash.

***Forces of the Firelands.*** Empty fields of cracked ground are patrolled by its denizens, including by far the largest amount of fleshy creatures of any elemental plane; molten magma giants, two-headed core hounds, serpentine flamewakers and their skeletal hound pets. Huge worms swim and hunt in the magma rivers, while beautiful giant fire hawks blaze across the sky.

> 
> ***Fire Storm (Recharge 5-6).*** The elemental creates a whirlwind of flame from its body, dealing 16 (3d10) fire damage to all creatures within 30 feet, or half damage on a successful DC 16 Dexterity save. This ability sets fire to flammable objects, and creatures that take any damage are ignited, taking 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of their turns until they take an action to put out the flame. <!-- https://wc5e-cr-calculator.frogvall.com/?1;15;138;8;16;42;5;38;5;38;5;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;;;;3;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;10;;;;;; -->

### Ice Elementals
Manifest from frozen water, ice elementals share domain and allegiance with other water elementals. It moves unhindered through the icy reaches in which it dwells, and is very quick to enrage at the sight of fire wielded in its vicinity.

***Unclear Origins.*** Ice elementals are one of the anomalous mysteries of the elemental world. Some shamans say they are simply a rare type of water elemental, frozen in form and associated with water in its solid state. Others claim that some ice elementals are unnatural conglomerate elementals of ice and earth, formed in unknown circumstances, who represent and govern the changing of summer to winter. The truth is unknown, as the only ones with that knowledge - the elementals themselves - are notorious for keeping their secrets close.

***Scattered Peoples.*** Unlike other elementals, there are no real homes for these creatures of ice. They tend to be found on their own or in small groups located around mountaintop glaciers or large ice floes. Only in Northrend are there large numbers of ice elementals, due to the eternal winter that grips most of the continent.

***The Ice Stone has Melted.*** The master elemental of frost is undoubtedly Ahune, the Frost Lord, a poorly-tempered elemental of immense power. Ahune, easily manipulated, seeks yearly to bring an end to the hated heat of high Summer, and at this time frost elementals will manifest across the globe, seeking to cool it through the creation of vast obelisks of ice. It is a plan doomed to fail, <br/> of course, and Ahune’s persistence is held at bay on each summer solstice through shamanic ritual.

### Water Elementals
<!-- A favoured companion among mages, human mages in particular, a water elemental is near impossible to discern while underwater. If able, it often attempts to deal with threats by luring them along into the water -- dragging them from there into the murky depths. -->

Amorphous masses of pure spring water, bound in bracers. Floating shards of ice the size of a man, glaring with cold stares. It is said that water elementals take on the fewest known types of all elementals, but this is untrue; the nature of water is shapelessness. Formless and versatile, water is the free-flowing element of change, and its elementals may take whatever form suits them. 

***Ebb and Flow.*** Water is the element of change, calm, and healing, but also of crushing depths, biting cold, and secrets hidden so far down that light may never reach them. Water’s servants, therefore, channel not only the restorative powers of fresh springs, but also the freezing, lashing, pressing force of deep oceans and frigid ice.

***A Spring of Calm.*** Water is seen as the most tranquil of elements, or at least the least volatile. Places significant to it are well known for their healing properties, particularly among shamanistic races. Spirits may similarly manifest in clean rivers, gushing waterfalls, or at the hearts of glaciers, wherever the water is purest. The many seas are the place of water’s greatest raw strength, and spirits of the sea are often far more robust. In places of corruption or filth, the elementals will become sickly and aggressive.

#### Abyssal Maw
Unsurprisingly, this plane is almost entirely underwater. It displays examples of all areas of sea life, from the well-lit shallow coral reefs to the lightless abyssal trenches that crisscross the ocean floor. Buildings are half made of carved stone and shells, and half of bubbles and froth, with windows made simply by supporting water vertically. 

***Elemental Hierarchy.*** The Maw is ruled by Neptulon the Tidehunter, who reigns from the Throne of the Tides. Much like the Firelands, there are a number of lords below him that assist the rule of the Elemental Lord. Unlike the armies of fire, the titles of nobility rarely change hands due to the adaptive nature of the aquatic masters. 

***Hydraxian Waterlords.*** While the other elements are content to help only those that appeal to themselves, water flows more freely, and its elementals are historically the most cooperative with mortals, even high-ranking lieutenants of the Tidehunter. On Azeroth, water’s servants have actively taken part in the defense of the world on multiple occasions, even as the others remained silent. 

***Masses of the Abyssal Maw.*** The denizens of the plane of water are far less rigidly categorised than the other planes, owing to water’s very nature. Those few who take solid shape at all will still only be vaguely humanoid, though some mortal races are closely associated with the plane, such as the sea giants, murlocs and, of course, millions of species of fish. In many ways, these mortal species show far more than the elements the heart of the element of water, as they are the most versatile sorts across the entire multiverse. The Elemental Lord of Water, Neptulon, represents this by seldom taking a solid form, preferring to exist among his element as raging tides, gentle currents and fatherly flows.

## Elemental Drakes

Elementals, the ancient proto-beings of a young world, take many forms.

First seen by mortal eyes during the Cataclysm of Azeroth, elemental drakes were quite a surprise to enterprising adventurers. Powerful elementals taking a form identical to the great dragons of Azeroth, the elemental drakes of Deepholm and Skywall - elemental realms of Earth and Air respectively - represent only a fraction of the elemental world, and yet their very existence is a mystery.

Enormous and deadly elemental predators, elemental drakes patrol their territories in their elemental homes without thought or agenda - they lack the deep and ancient intellect that true dragons possess, and instead live as powerful elemental beasts. Through their connection to their mother element, they demonstrate much of the power and danger seen in fleshy dragons, with powerful elemental breath and hurricane force within their wings - however, their animal instinct makes them impossible to reason with, and their size and habits make them far more dangerous than many other elementals, most of which are intelligent and sometimes not immediately hostile.

In their elemental realms, these dragons have been seen fulfilling natural roles, but in the hands of more intelligent beings - higher elementals, cultists or cruel shamans - they have been subjugated into guards and mounts. This smuggling of drakes did not go unnoticed by the elementals of their home realms, but in the case of Deepholm, nobody much cared; in the case of Skywall, many of them were gifts by Ak’akir, the Windlord, to loyal followers. In all cases, these dragons did not adapt well to foreign climates, and none are seen naturally across Azeroth.

***Draconic Origins.*** The elemental drakes represent an historian's conundrum; they appear to have existed for aeons uninterrupted, locked away from Azeroth since creation, and yet they are identical in almost every way to contemporary dragons. It is not known how this could have happened, but it is possible that these animalistic elementals are the oldest common ancestor to modern dragons, and as such, elemental drakes may be the precursor to all draconic life on Azeroth. The truth, of course, is unknown - elementals are not forthcoming with details, and the drakes cannot speak.

### Stone Drakes

The stalwart stone drakes found in Deepholm, the elemental plane of the Earth, were the first elemental drakes to be seen by mystified mortals. Undisturbed for aeons, generations of these drakes had hatched, lived, hunted, bred and died across the shelves of higher Deepholm, of which they have near-total domination, as the only true high-flying elementals of the realm. There they hunt the few fleshy creatures to be found in the elemental plane. They appear to be unconcerned with elemental matters; they follow only the strongest broodmother in a colony, and otherwise do not obey the word of shamans, or even of the Stonemother, Therazane.

***Stone Nature.*** Their skins are solid rock, studded with gemstone growths, crystalline spines and horns, and wings webbed with mineral filament. They are exceptionally, impossibly heavy, and yet their flight seems effortless. This is yet another mystery of the elemental drakes.

> ##### Variant: Precious Stones
> There are as many types of stone drakes as their are varieties of stone. Some drakes take after certain varieties, changing their breath weapons to take on one of the following properties:
> 
> **Phosphorescent.** The drake spews radiation, dealing necrotic damage and causing those who fail their saving throws to gain one level of exhaustion, and they must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or contract the radiation disease (Manual of Monsters page ###).
>
> **Sandstone.** The drake exhales a gust of sand, dealing slashing damage and blinding those who fail their saving throws until the end of the drake's next turn.
>
> **Slate.** The drake's breath weapon is a gust of stone dust, dealing no damage and requiring a Constitution saving throw instead. Each creature in the area who fails their save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends on the target. On a failure, the target is petrified until freed by the *greater restoration* spell or other magic.
>
> **Vitreous.** The drake unleashes a hail of sharp crystal shards, becoming a line 5 feet wide and twice as long as their original breath weapon. The attack deals piercing damage and those who fail their saving throw have their bodies embedded with small shards of volcanic glass. Each time they move more than half their speed, they take 2 (1d4) piercing damage from the shards. The shards can be removed with the *lesser restoration* spell or a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
>
> **Volcanic.** The drake exhales a jet of lava, dealing fire damage instead. In addition, the area hit by the lava becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, they take 5 (1d10) fire damage.

### A Stone Drake's Lair
Stone drake lairs are located in the immense caverns of Deepholm, where they can take full advantage of their flight abilities. Typically they nest near confluences of geomagnetic energies, often marked by veins of lava or forests of crystal shards.

### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the drake can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

- Stalactites fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the drake can see within 120 feet of it. The drake makes one ranged attack roll (+9 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.

### Storm Drakes 
In Skywall, the kingdom of clouds occupied by air elementals, the elemental storm drakes drift lazily across the endless sky, held aloft by the myriad wind currents that make up their home. Only seldom do they leave the clouds, let alone land on their feet. Their sleek, pearlescent scales seem almost textureless, like glass, but their stormy moods and the hurricane force of their wings are more than tangible.

***Stormguard.*** Storm drakes are utilized by the cunning elementals of air as guardians of the few constructed temples in Skywall, through subjugation and cruel magic. Here the drakes demonstrate a powerful and abiding territorial nature, enforcing hurricane force winds to drive away enemies - usually opposing elementals seeking to off a political foe, though more recently landbound adventurers have found just how dangerous these winds can be.

> ##### Variant: The Four Winds
> Some drakes show an affinity for the winds of one of the four cardinal directions. Their breath weapon changes to reflect this, gaining one of the following properties:
> 
> ***Breath of the North Wind.*** The drake's breath becomes wintry, dealing cold damage and causing creatures who fail their saving throw to have their movement speed reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. In addition, the area affected by the breath weapon becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute due to leftover sleet.
>
> ***Breath of the East Wind.*** The drake's breath becomes that of a storm-force gale, extinguishing unprotected fires, dispersing vapors and gas, and causing creatures who fail their saving throw to be pushed back up to the far range of drake's breath weapon. 
>
> ***Breath of the South Wind.*** The drake's breath becomes laced with a thunderstorm, dealing lightning damage and causing those who fail their saving throw to become deafened for 1 minute.
>
> ***Breath of the West Wind.*** The drake's breath carries the scent of pollen and toxic spores. Creatures who fail their saving throw become poisoned until the beginning of the drake's next turn.

### A Storm Drake's Lair
A storm drake's lair is a location within Skywall, typically where at least two of the four winds meet. As such locations are typically locations of settlements, ancient storm drakes often are subjugated under the rule of a powerful djinn.

### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the drake can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
- A lightning bolt touches down at a point the drake chooses within 120 feet. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures wearing armor made of metal have disadvantage on this saving throw.

- The drake creates an area of strong wind in the shape of a 40-foot radius sphere centered on it. The wind moves in a single direction, such as north or west, chosen by the drake. Each creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet in the direction of the wind. Any creature in the area must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves against the wind, while movement speed in the direction of the wind is doubled. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished. The wind remains centered on the drake and lasts it uses this lair action again or until it dies.

## Elemental Mote
Elemental motes are the least of the elemental creatures. Typically they act as servitors to the higher elementals or as assistants to the creatures who summon them.

***Elemental Fragments.*** [Explanation of source of motes. Sites of battles between shamans or mages, locations of powerful ley line or land energies, from the bodies of powerful elementals, etc.]

***???.*** [Explanation that they lack the energy and substance of proper elementals, but their loose composition in comparison to proper elementals means that their energy can leak into similarly aligned creatures. It takes a strong connection for most of the motes. For example, a mote of air wouldn't benefit a flying creature just because of that, the creature would need to be deeply connected to the sky/air.]

### Elemental Mote Types
Elemental motes come in several types. Each one is slightly different than the other, with the differences noted below.

#### Motes of Air
A mote of air appears to be a very small dust devil. It is typically found in areas of high winds or where powerful air elementals perished.

A mote of air has a fly speed of 40 feet, can cast *gust*, and deals bludgeoning damage with its slam attack. Creatures that benefit from its elemental aura include air elementals and most shamans and they can use its sacrificial blessing to take the Dash action as a bonus action. 

#### Motes of Earth
A mote of earth appears to be a small amount of orbiting pebbles and dust. It is typically found in areas of seismic disturbances or near a fallen earth elemental.

A mote of earth has a burrow speed of 20 feet, has vulnerability to thunder damage, can cast *mold earth*, and deals bludgeoning damage with its slam attack. Creatures that benefit from its elemental aura include earth elementals, dwarves, and most shamans and they can use its sacrificial blessing to gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage dealt from one attack.

#### Motes of Fire

> ##### By Your Powers Combined
> When multiple elemental motes work together, they can combine to form into a greater elemental. If at least four elemental motes of the same type arrange in a 10 foot square and spend their turns this round using their action and movement to focus, they can combine to form another creature. This creature is at full health and has no conditions no matter the status of the motes. The kind of creature formed depends on the motes involved:
> Mote Type|Creature Formed
> ---------|---------------
> Air|**Lesser Air Elemental**
> Earth|**Lesser Earth Elemental**
> Fire|**Lesser Fire Elemental**
> Harmony|**Ancient Spirit** (any)
> Life|***Beast*** *or* ***Plant*** (any, CR 2 or below)
> Mana|**Arcane Wyrm** *or* **Lesser Arcane Elemental**
> Shadow|**Voidwalker**
> Water|**Lesser Water Elemental**

## Elemental Revenants

The elemental revenants are yet another long-unsolved mystery among many others out in the frozen land of Northrend. Far up at the cap of the world, these elemental spirits appear to be bound within enormous, ancient sets of rough-hewn armor, drifting along above the ground as though caught in gentle breeze. They are rare and, when seen, often appear to be following some kind of distant, obscure desire to stand guard, following no apparent patterns or goals beyond protecting a single area for centuries at a time.

***Mysterious Origins.*** Though they are elemental in nature, these entities are vanishingly rare outside of Northrend, and are not seen in their respective elemental planes. It is yet unknown why they act and appear the way they do, or even if they originated as elementals.

***Complex Loyalties.*** Some of the revenants of Northrend have been seen serving a mysterious master in the mountains, though for what purpose, to what end, and how deep this loyalty lies is unknown.

***Tundra Ghosts.*** The revenants that drift across the snow, barely visible through blizzards and mist, have a ghostly, ethereal quality to them, and are believed by some local cultures to be the spirits of dead warriors bound eternally to their armor. 

### Air Revenant
Arcing electricity and static clinging to armour or weapons herald the arrival of an air or lightning revenant, twisted ribbons of rough metal wrapped around a powerful vortex. Lightning comes to their aid, wielded like a club, while the currents of air around them whip and tug at their foes. Their voices, shrill shrieks, are that of the most violent of icy gales.

### Death Revenant
A mystery even greater than the cause of elemental revenants is the death revenants, so seldom seen as to border on mythical. Spoken of in hushed tones, and only when the sun is high, these fell spirits are said to be spirits of death itself. Great black scythes are wielded empty metal husks, who move eerily silent and speak only to the mind. It is unknown if these dread reapers are even of the same ilk as other revenants, and their desires are, once again, a mystery.

### Earth Revenant
Plumes of stones and dry earth support stout, sturdy plates roughly riveted together. A massive club, thick enough to topple walls, drifts nearby. An earth revenant wields pure, raw power, roaming their territories slowly, with the assurance that any opposition will be completely flattened. 

### Fire Revenant
Jagged, scaled armor kept red-hot by the blazing flames within, a fire revenant resembles a floating foundry, spewing molten slag and burning coals in its wake. Unlike most revenants, their weapons are well-crafted and often beautiful, albeit hot enough to brand their foes with artful scars. When rarely seen outdoors in Northrend, the extreme heat flowing out of their bodies clashes with the cold and blankets them in steam.

\columnbreak

### Water Revenant
Smooth pots or jugs - connected to a water revenant's armoured body by thick chains - constantly spill out with the clear, freezing water that comprises the vague appearance of a body. Frigid temperatures accompany these revenants, who may well be the most at home in the icy land of Northrend. Water ebbs and flows at their command, frostbite awaits anyone at the receiving end of their jagged, cruel scimitars.

> ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The dragon's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 20, +12 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
> 
> At will: ✦ *diabolism*, ✦ *flurry*, *shape water* ^XGE^, <br/>     *sleet storm*
> <br/> 3/day each: ✦ *blizzard*, *dispel magic*, *fog cloud*, <br/>     *ray of enfeeblement*
> <br/> 1/day each: *shadow of moil* ^XGE^, *wall of ice*
> 
> ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) cold damage.
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.
>
> ***Tail Sweep.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach <br/> 15 ft., all targets in reach. *Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.
>
> ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
>
> ***Frost Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature who fails their saving throw has their movement speed halved and can't take reactions for 1 minute. If they fail their save by 5 or more, they are also entombed in ice.
> <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While entombed, they have total cover and are restrained and incapacitated. At the beginning of their turn, they take 13 (3d8) cold damage and can attempt a DC 18 Strength check, breaking free from the ice on a success. The ice can be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp equal to cold damage taken by the breath weapon; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage).
>
> ### Legendary Actions
> The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
>
> **Icy Grip.** Each creature within 40 feet of the dragon 
<br/>    must make a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be 
<br/>    pulled to the closest unoccupied space next to the 
<br/>    dragon.
> <br/> **Sleet Storm.** The dragon casts *sleet storm*.
> <br/> **Ice Tomb (Costs 2 Actions).** A creature the dragon can 
<br/>    see within 60 feet must make a DC 20 Dexterity 
<br/>    saving throw or become entombed in ice, as if they 
<br/>    were affected by Frost Breath (30 hit points). On a 
<br/>    successful save, they instead have their speed halved 
<br/>    and cannot take reactions until the dragon's next 
<br/>    turn.
> <br/> **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its 
<br/>    wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon 
<br/>    must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or 
<br/>    take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be 
<br/>    knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its 
<br/>    flying speed.

## Oozes
Oozes (also known as slimes) are a type of mindless slime creatures. They are known to adapt to their environments, taking on aspects of their surroundings, which may account for the variety of oozes seen on Azeroth and beyond.

***Unknown Origin.*** No one knows what their motivations are or if there is any specific ecology behind their existence. One theory is that oozes and slimes are tied to the creation of Azeroth, almost like a secretion of the planet. Another theory correlates their existence with that of the Old Gods and thus potent Void energies. Neither theory has been proven as of yet.

***Slow Death.*** 

***Adaptive Nature.*** Oozes form in locations of powerful energies and take on the characteristics of their surroundings. Thus oozes make for good litmus tests for environmental conditions. Oozes from different locations rarely resemble each other in more than superficial ways, even among similar origins.

***Ooze Nature.*** An ooze doesn't require sleep.

<!-- <div style='margin-top:20px;'></div> -->

### Black Tar
Tar pits have been death traps for creatures since prehistoric times. Occasionally a pit will give rise to oozes that are not satisfied with just the creatures that fall into the pits and will seek out nearby victims.

<!-- \columnbreak
<div style='margin-top:570px;'></div> -->

### Corrosive Sludge
When areas of filth are left unattended for long periods of time, an ooze known as a putrid waste will spawn. When those areas are left to fester and rot for even longer, a far more deadly variety known as the corrosive sludge will appear. Possessing a powerful acidic body, these creatures will eat through almost anything given time.

### Glutinous Ooze
The primal energies of the Un'goro Crater are known to give rise to these creatures. They are sometimes mispronounced as gluttonous oozes, though both descriptors are accurate due to these slimes being as sticky as they are ravenous.

### Possessed Blood
When shed from powerful creatures or created through dark magics, blood can take on a semblance of life. These globules of blood seek to drain the lifeblood of other creatures and can be absorbed into the bloodstream of those who animated them.

### Putrid Waste
These oozes are the most commonly encountered variety, arising in areas where filth has been allowed to accumulate and fester.

<!-- Creator's Notes: CR calculation is weird for oozes. As best I can tell, Split causes the CR calculation to be done as if the ooze had been reduced to as many oozes as possible. So for example a Large ooze would have 1/4 the hp but deal 4x the damage. Without that, the ochre jelly is a CR 1/2 creature, with it it's about a CR 2-3.  -->

> ***Amorphous.*** The tar can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the weapon's wielder can't or won't let go of the weapon, the wielder is grappled while the weapon is stuck. While stuck, the weapon can't be used. A creature can pull the weapon free by taking an action to make a DC 12 Strength check and succeeding.
> 
> ***Tar Body.*** If the tar takes any fire damage, its body becomes more viscous and its speed increases by 10 feet until the end of its next turn. 
> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it takes at least 5 points of fire damage on a turn, its body ignites until the end of its next turn. While ignited, a creature that touches the tar or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 3 (1d6) fire damage, and the tar deals an additional 3 (1d6) fire damage with its attacks.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Pseudopod.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.
> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, the creature must make a DC 12 Dexterity save or have bits of tar stick to it, reducing its movement speed by 10 feet to a minimum of 0. When its speed is reduced to 0 it is considered restrained. This effect stacks with itself and lasts for 1 hour or until the tar is washed off with at least 1 gallon of alcohol as an action.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Split.*** When a tar that is Medium or larger is subjected to slashing damage, it splits into two new tars if it has at least 10 hit points. Each new tar has hit points equal to half the original tar's, rounded down. New tars are one size smaller than the original tar.

## The Plague

At the onset of the Third War, the human kingdom of Lordaeon was wracked and devastated by a new, virulent and extremely infectious disease known only as The Plague. No other name was needed. Spreading from infected grain, within days the plague had spread across Lordaeron’s smaller villages and into major population centers. 

While the priests and paladins of Lordaeron attempted to intervene, the many human victims succumbed to the symptoms of nausea, vomiting, pus-filled boils, exhaustion, delirium, and eventually death. It was then that the final symptom showed itself.

In the dead of night, as bodies began to pile up and quarantine measures were started, the infected dead of Lordaeron began to rise again, walking as undead. Still infectious, and now filled with ravenous hunger, the disease-riddled undead began to rip into their own homes, tearing Lordaeron apart from the inside.

From afar, evil minds were satisfied, for the Plague of Undeath had been orchestrated entirely by the Cult of the Damned, a secret cult of necromancers working for the undead Scourge, at the behest of their leader, the necromancer Kel’thuzad. It was crafted for one thing; create bodies for the Scourge’s use.

The plague, an enormous success, has since left Lordaeron a desolate and empty land, its forests blighted and its earth spongy and sick. Nothing grows, and what little lives there lives a sickly, unpleasant life. Undead wander aimlessly in droves, while the remains of the Scourge’s war machines lay rotting in the sun. A kingdom suffering the full brunt of the Scourge’s plague, Lordaeron is a deadplace, where only the dead live.

Its test site proved a success, and so the Scourge has gone on to employ the Plague of Undeath in grand style, and in countless forms across the world.

<br/>

<div style='margin-top:470px;'></div>

***Virulent Strain.*** The Plague of Undeath was crafted by skilled hands under the command of the Lich King, whose overwhelming power over death bolstered the plague’s power. It was one of several strains of blight and death crafted, and was made specifically to facilitate the conversion of living populations into the undead; those killed become extremely easy to revive into undead, while being extremely hard to cure, as well as infectious to a staggering degree. It is deadly only after time has passed for sufficient infection to spread. It is, in other words, a masterpiece, and a marvel of modern science.

***Ascended Lifeforms.*** To the Scourge, few things are more important than finding new ways to deliver the Plague rapidly. In the old days it was grain, but now they are far more direct: canisters of weaponized diseased fluid; undead monsters loaded with exploding infected pus; infected claws and teeth; dragons that breathe infection across the sky; even the land itself is not safe, as the grubs and worms that fester in diseased corpses then burrow underground to spread the infection further. The experimentation of the Scourge upon living and undead creatures never ceases, and neither do the depths of their ingenuity.

***The Blight.*** A late-stage sign of deep, irreversible infection upon an area is called Blight, and it is a sure sign that the undead have chosen a place as base of operations. No longer grassy and live, the very earth has become sick, with spongy soil riddled with worms bursting out, not with grass and trees, but with fungus, a sickly mycelium growing over and choking previous life, and gigantic mushrooms taking their place. A malaise takes over these regions, with a thick mist adding to an atmosphere of terror. Even worse is the sound; these regions are totally silent. Everything is dead. Here, the undead flourish, strengthened by the death in the air.

### Disease: Plague of Undeath
While there have been several plagues throughout history, when someone mentions "*the* plague," they are referring to the Plague of Undeath, a deadly necromantic disease that ravaged most of the Eastern Kingdoms during the Third War. 

The Plague affects species differently. The original Plague mostly killed humanoids, causing them to rise as zombies and other undead, while some flora and fauna instead sprouted plague-filled growths. The New Plague developed by certain Forsaken apothecaries could even kill the undead. Other variants have existed, developed in alchemical labs and secret cabals.
 
When a creature is exposed to a source of the plague--such as through breathing spores, eating infested grain, or an open wound--they must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, contracting the disease on a failure.
 
It takes 1d4 days for the plague’s symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms range from fatigue, nausea, fever, to minor hallucinations. When it manifests, the infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion and regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.
 
At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the creature’s exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature’s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease. 

The plague is resistant to magic. It cannot be cured except by removing exhaustion levels, and immunity to disease only provides advantage on saves against it. If a creature dies from exhaustion while under this disease, necromantic energies infect the body. Every 24 hours it has a 5% chance to rise as an uncontrolled zombie. If *create undead* or similar spells are cast on the corpse, they do not require material components and the created undead remain under the caster's control indefinitely.

<div style='margin-top:-8px;'></div>

### Plagued Template
A living creature who becomes infected by the plague, yet does not perish from it. Typically they are beasts or plants, as most humanoids die from the plague while most constructs, fiends, or undead are unaffected by it. Plagued creatures manifest different symptoms, such as pus-filled sores and open wounds, green or orange coloration, or fungal growths. 

They retain their statistics unless otherwise stated, and gain the following traits. 

***Alignment.*** The plagued creature's alignment is neutral evil.

***Deadly Plague.*** Poison damage that the plagued creature deals ignores resistance and immunity to poison damage. It can inflict the poisoned condition even on creatures normally immune to it. When it deals a critical hit, the target is infected with the plague of undeath.

***Death Burst.*** The plagued creature lets out a burst of toxic sludge when it drops to 0 hit points. Each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage and become infected with the plague of undeath on a failed save. A successful save results in half damage and no other effect.

***Attacks.*** When the plagued creature hits with a melee attack, it deals an additional 3 (1d6) poison damage.

### Plagued Proto-Dragons
During the Scourge’s spread across Northrend, a cult of worship had begun among native vrykul populations, recently awoken from long slumber. Worshipping the Lich King as a god of death, the vrykul of the Storm Peaks began volunteering to the cause their longtime, ancient animal companions - the proto-dragons, their long-established pets, mounts and friends.

So incensed by this, the necromancers and plague-doctors of the Scourge resumed long abandoned experiments in crafting a new breed of dragon, a plagued dragonflight crafted to spread disease wherever they may fly. In the past this had failed miserably, with few living past whelphood.

Through the use of blighted pools loaded with countless clutches of stolen eggs, the throwback dragon species were far more receptive than the old experiments, and were able to grow into adulthood despite their infusion with deathly, sickly disease. Bleached a pale green and with eternally addled minds, these great, loyal beasts were broken from birth to obey their necromancer masters, and were granted as gifts to vrykul champions of the Scourge, to act as mounts and as vectors of further infection.

The new dragonflight of plagued proto-dragons took to the sky, a terrifying reminder of the totality of the Lich King’s reign over Northrend, reducing even its ancient heritage to his minions.

### Plagued Dragons

Beneath the earth in the dread catacombs of Scholomance, the Cult of the Damned performed sick and twisted experiments on the living. Even dragons were not exempt, as the Cult had "procured" some Black Dragonflight eggs, and had begun efforts to create a living dragonflight worthy of the Scourge.

Sickly green in hue and diseased from the egg, constantly covered in sores and festering wounds, these insane creatures know only suffering and pain, which they seek only to inflict upon others. Through their blighted breath they flood their foes with sickness, spreading the dreaded Plague of Undeath to the living.

***Infant mortality.*** As the Cult has learned, deathly disease causes the rapid end of life, and as such most of these foul creatures have died before they could reach adulthood. Those that do not may also become so unstable or sick that they are simply unable to function. Indeed, a great portion of the experiments - and why the Cult constantly needs new eggs - have been devoted to working out how to extend the dragonwhelps' lives, and suffering, further. 

***Affront to life.*** No people of morality or goodwill may sleep soundly knowing these creatures are alive and suffering, and some groups have devoted their time to eliminating this experiment for good. Unfortunately, they realise that the only way to end the experiment is to end Scholomance itself, a task sought out only by the most powerful among Azeroth's defenders.

<br/>    that is permanently under its command, following its 
<br/>    verbal orders to the best of its ability.

<br/>    light becomes dim light and dim light becomes 
<br/>    darkness. Any nonmagical light sources within the 
<br/>    area have the light they produce suppressed. This 
<br/>    effect lasts until the end of the dragon's next turn 
<br/>    and moves with the dragon.
> <br/> **Wrack.** Target creature within 120 feet the dragon can 
<br/>    see must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw 
<br/>    or have disadvantage on Strength-based attack rolls, 
<br/>    checks, and saving throws for 1 minute. A creature 
<br/>    can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
<br/>    turns, ending the effects on itself on a success.
> <br/> **Death and Decay (Costs 2 Actions).** Each non-undead 
<br/>    creature within 30 feet must make a DC 18
<br/>    Constituion saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) necrotic 
<br/>    damage on a failed save. Until the end of its next 
<br/>    turn, whenever the creature makes an attack roll 
<br/>    or saving throw, it must roll a d4 and subtract the 
<br/>    number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw. 
<br/>    A successful save results in half damage and no
<br/>    other effects.
> <br/> **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its 
<br/>    wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon 
<br/>    must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or

## Storm Dragons

In mountainous Stormheim, the half-giant Vrykul both revere and fear the mighty Storm dragons, who rule the skies and the mountaintops as uncontested kings.

Deep purple or red scales laced with wild electricity, wings like shocks of thunder, and slim, lean bodies characterise these mysterious cousins to the true Dragonflights. Little is known of them, other than their undisputed mastery of Stormhein's stormy skies, but it is known that they are noble and considerate creatures... to those they consider worthy.

***Noble Cousins.*** The storm dragons appear unrelated to the five great Dragonflights, and were given no charge, blessing, nor obligations by the Titans. Nevertheless, they hold in their hearts the noble strength and will of dragonkind, and to the Vrykul of Stormheim they are close to divine, acting as respected protectors of Vrykul tradition.

***Flight Divided.*** These are several broods of storm dragons, each loyal to their brood mother. These broods display differing loyalties and intentions, forging their own alliances, rivalries and intentions independent of one another. While some may protect Stormheim's occupants, others may believe themselves above such things and claim land as their own, and its people as food. As such, the vrykul below them are always ready with offerings - or harpoons.

Storm dragons lair in high mountains, where heavy ore content results in heavy storms and regular lightning strikes. 

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same lair action twice in a row:

- Static electricity sparks from all surfaces. Each creature within 120 feet of the dragon must roll a d6. On a 6, they are struck by a stray bolt of lightning, taking 10 (3d6) lightning damage. A creature wielding a metal weapon or wearing metal armor is struck on a roll of 5 or 6.
- The storm dragon is struck by a bolt of lightning. It takes no damage, but has advantage on all attack rolls and saving throws until it performs its next lair action.

<br/>    In addition, any creature damaged by the storm strike has disadvantage on saving throws against effects that deal lightning damage until the end of the dragon's next turn.
