#### Quick Build
You can make a demon hunter quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength or Dexterity, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or finesse weapons, with your next-highest score should be Charisma. Second, choose the Criminal or Outlander background.

#### Optional Rule: Multiclassing
If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the *Player's Handbook*, here's what you need to know if you choose demon hunter as one of your classes.

***Ability Score Minimum.*** As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Dexterity and Charisma score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a demon hunter.

***Proficiencies Gained.*** If demon hunter isn't your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a demon hunter: light armor, simple weapons, and martial weapons.

***Multiclassing with Warlock.*** If your demon hunter bears the Mark of Havoc and also has warlock levels, add one-third of your demon hunter levels (rounded down) to your warlock level and consult the warlock class table for total spell slots, cantrips known, and spell slot level.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Unarmored Defense
*1st-level demon hunter feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier.

### Illidari Initiation
*1st-level demon hunter feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You have gone through the harrowing process of initiation into the Illidari, having slain a demon, consumed its flesh, and bound its soul to your own. 

As part of the process, your eyes are removed and your skin is inscribed with glowing arcane tattoos to help keep the demonic power inside you in check, though your body is mutated, giving you one or more mutations from the Demonic Mutations table. 

Additionally, you gain the following traits: 
- You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track fiends and demons, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about such creatures.
- You can speak, read, and write Eredun. 
- You appear as both humanoid and fiend (demon) to any effect that detects fiends or demons, but are not affected by those that adversely affect those creature types, like *magic circle* or *dispel evil and good*.
- You cannot be possessed by a fiend or demon.

#### Fel
You can tap into a deep wellspring of chaotic energy within yourself. This wellspring is represented by fel points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.

You have 1 fel point, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Fel Points column of the Demon Hunter table. You can never have more fel points than shown on the table for your level. Your fel point total returns to full when you finish a short or long rest.

The number of fel points you have can reach negative numbers, representing you pushing beyond the limits of safety in exchange for power. When you use a fel point ability that pushes your fel point total below 0, roll a d4 and add your current fel point total to the roll. 

If the result is 0 or below, you take an amount of necrotic damage equal to your demon hunter level. This damage can’t be reduced in any way.

Some class features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Fel save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br> your Charisma modifier

</div>

\columnbreak

##### Demonic Mutations
d12|Mutation
---|-------
1 |Your skin has turned an unnatural shade, such as red, green, dark purple, or pitch black.
2 |Your blood glows green, showing through your skin.
3 |Your skin has grown thick colored scales.
4 |You have grown horns, either short and stubby or long, curled, and jagged.
5 |Your voice echoes slightly, as if several people are speaking at once.
6 |Your nails turn hard and black, becoming like claws.
7 |Your canine teeth grow long and jagged, turning into fangs or tusks.
8 |You grow a long spaded tail. It is non-prehensile.
9 |Your feet turn into cloven hooves.
10|Your skin sprouts small spikes or spines.
11|Your eye sockets burn with a green flame that can be seen even when obscured by cloth or leather.
12|You have some other, nonfunctional mutation, as approved by the GM.

### Chaos Blades
*1st-level demon hunter feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You can use fel points to infuse your weapons with the raw power of chaos. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 fel point to imbue one weapon you're holding, enhancing it until you finish a short or long rest. 

While the weapon is imbued, attacks you make with it are magical and deal an additional 1d4 chaos damage. See the Chaos Damage sidebar for more details.

The amount of extra damage dealt increases as you level: 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 11th level, and 1d10 at 17th level. Other creatures can’t gain the benefit of your chaos blades.

> #### Chaos Damage
> A number of demon hunter features refer to chaos damage. Chaos damage is a mix of raw chaotic energies that can result in several potential damage types. 
>
> Whenever you deal chaos damage, roll a number of d8s equal to the number of chaos damage dice and select one, consulting the Chaos Damage table to determine the damage type. 
>
> For example, if an effect deals 2d6 chaos damage and you roll two d8s resulting in 1 and 6, then you deal 2d6 points of either acid or poison damage.
>
> ##### Chaos Damage
> d8 | Damage Type    |d8 | Damage Type
> ---|----------------|---|------------
> 1  | Acid           | 5 | Lightning
> 2  | Cold           | 6 | Poison
> 3  | Fire           | 7 | Psychic
> 4  | Force          | 8 | Thunder

When you reach 9th level, you can focus your vision to pierce through matter as well as magic. You can spend 2 fel points to see into and through solid matter within 30 feet. To you, solid objects within range appear transparent and don't prevent light from passing through them.

This x-ray vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.

### Invocations
*2nd-level demon hunter feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You can draw upon dark secrets and the power of souls through magical abilities known as invocations. 

You gain two invocations of your choice. When you gain certain demon hunter levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Demon Hunter table. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

### Fighting Style
*2nd-level demon hunter feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to use this benefit.

#### Profane Warrior
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. They count as death knight spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the warlock spell list.

\columnbreak

#### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

> #### Optional Class Features
> See Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, Pg. 41 for additional Fighting Styles. The Blind Fighting, Superior Technique, and Unarmed Fighting styles are appropriate choices for this class.

### Demonic Mark
*3rd-level demon hunter feature*

### Extra Attack
*5th-level demon hunter feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Evasion
*7th-level demon hunter feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

Your keen instincts lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an *ice storm* spell. When you are subjected to an an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the save, and only half damage if you fail.

### Metamorphosis
*11th-level demon hunter feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You can let the demon bound within you take control. On your turn, you can as a bonus action let your bound demon morph your body with demonic features for 1 minute. While in Metamorphosis, you gain the following benefits.
- Your creature type becomes fiend.
- You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your demon hunter level plus your Charisma modifier. These temporary hit points only last while you are in this form.
- Your weapon attacks are infused by Chaos Blades if they weren't already. This enhancement only lasts until the end of your metamorphosis.
- Whenever you would roll a die of Chaos Damage, you roll an additional one.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you spend 3 fel points to use it again.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

Your arcane tattoos help protect you from harm. Whenever you make an Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, you may add your Charisma modifier to the check (minimum of +1).

### Revealing Gaze
*14th-level demon hunter feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

Your body and soul are both corrupted and protected by fel energy, granting you the following traits:
- You are considered both a humanoid and fiend (demon). You can be affected by anything that would affect either of those creature types. 
- You do not suffer from the frailty of age, can't be aged magically, and will not die of old age. You no longer need food or water.
- You cannot be charmed or frightened.
- You have advantage on saves versus any effect that exclusively affects fiends or demons.

### Prepared
*20th-level demon hunter feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

Your supernatural senses allow you to act at a moments notice. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn on initiative count 30 and your second turn at your rolled initiative.

Furthermore, you can transform into and out of Metamorphosis at will as a bonus action. You only gain temporary hit points the first time you transform after a short or long rest, unless you spend 2 fel points.

For example, when you are 8th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell *Witch Bolt*, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.

***Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher.*** At 3rd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Mark of Wrath Spellcasting table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 11th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class and mark, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<div style="text-align: center">

**Spell save** DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

#### Felblade
*3rd-level Mark of Wrath feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

While you have an active Chaos Blades, you can use your weapon as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells, and when you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.

#### Unrestrained Fury
*6th-level Mark of Wrath feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

When you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can immediately make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

#### Profane Sigils
*6th-level Mark of Wrath feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You can brand creatures with debilitating sigils. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is branded for 1 minute with a sigil of your choice from the list below. 

The brand ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Once you brand a target, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

##### Sigil of Binding
A creature affected by this sigil cannot take the Dash or Disengage action. If the creature attempts to teleport or leave their current plane via ability, spell, or portal, they take chaos damage equal to your demon hunter level and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the teleport or plane shift fails.

##### Sigil of Chains

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

##### Sigil of Flame

##### Sigil of Misery

##### Sigil of Silence

##### Sigil of Weakness
You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus. Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

#### Chaos Brand
*10th-level Mark of Wrath feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

Your Profane Sigils feature digs dark arcane scars into your target, leaving them vulnerable to your magic. A creature branded by you has disadvantage on saving throws against your warlock spells.

#### Unleashed Power
*15th-level Mark of Wrath feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

As a bonus action, you can regain an expended spell slot by invoking a number of fel points equal to the spell's level. You cannot use this feature to restore a spell slot with a higher slot level than you can cast through Fel Sorcery, and each time you use this feature after the first, you must spend an additional fel point.

#### Relentless Rage
*18th-level Mark of Wrath feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

When you use your action to cast a spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

## Fel Secrets

### Analyze Blood
**[Based on [this spell.](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/11498-analyze-blood) Potentially also the Blood Hunter's Grim Psychometry ability.]**

### Brand of the Hunt
**[Can mark a target with a brand that lets you know where they are and allows you to teleport short distances to them.]**

### Consume Magic
*Prerequisite: 9th level*

While you have an active Chaos Blades, when you hit a creature, object, or magical effect with that weapon, you can spend 2 fel points to cast *dispel magic* as a bonus action against the target. If you successfully dispel a spell, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus plus the spell's level.

### Immolation Aura
You can spend 1 fel point to engulf yourself in flames for 1 minute, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light in an additional 30 feet. 

For the duration, a creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you, touches you, or hits you with a melee attack while within 5 feet of you takes fire damage equal to half your demon hunter level.

### Immortal Soul
*Prerequisite: 15th level*

If you are killed, your soul is drawn into the Twisting Nether, where your body will eventually reform in a random location within 1d10 days. When it does, your original body decays rapidly to dust. You can still be returned to life through spells like *raise dead* before this occurs.

When you are returned to life this way, you have a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time you finish a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears. If you are killed again while you have this penalty, you die permanently. 

**[Based on a lich phylactery. How would a character with this get back to the party?]**

### Infernal Strike
**[Based on an infernal's meteoric impact.]**

### Master of Chains
**[Benefits when wielding whip, spiked chain, similar weapons. Can cause the weapon to expand and bind/trip opponents. Think Ivy from Soul Calibur.]**

### Master of the Glaive
**[Benefits when wielding warglaives. Returning property, potential rebound off of targets, etc.]**

\columnbreak

### Mutation: X
**[A category of functional mutations, in comparison to the cosmetic mutations from Illidari Initiation. Each provides a specific benefit, along with an enhanced benefit while in Metamorphosis.]**

*(Grouped for sake of ease for now, will be separate invocations in the final version.)*

#### Mutation: Blood
**[Glowing blood effect. Acid blood? Improved hp?]**

#### Mutation: Claws
**[Can grow claws.]**

#### Mutation: Eyes
**[Can shoot lasers from your eyes. You transform into the metamorphosis form to use this ability in WoW anyway.]**

#### Mutation: Fangs
**[Grow fangs and bite attack. Lizardfolk style healing bite?]**

#### Mutation: Hooves
**[Increased speed? Stability?]**

#### Mutation: Horns
**[More sturdy horns than those in demonic mutations, allowing for gore effects.]**

#### Mutation: Scales
**[Provides bonus AC and fire resistance.]**

#### Mutation: Skin
**[Chameleon effect.]**

#### Mutation: Spikes
**[Causes damage to attackers.]**

#### Mutation: Tail
**[Tail becomes prehensile.]**

#### Mutation: Voice
**[Compelling voice. Shout attack when transformed?]**

#### Mutation: Wings
You gain the ability to manifest a pair of bat-like wings from your back. You can do so as a bonus action, or as a reaction made when falling, and they last until you dismiss them as a bonus action.

While your wings are manifested, your jump distance is doubled. You can also use the wings to glide, reducing your falling speed to 60 feet per round (taking no damage when landing) and allowing you to move horizontally up to 120 feet per round when doing so.

You can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.

While you are in Metamorphosis, you have a fly speed equal to twice your movement speed.

### Netherwalk
**[Can Dash, Disengage, and Dodge? Can't attack or be attacked, double speed, 1 round.]**

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Shattered Souls 
When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your demon hunter level (minimum of 1). 

If the creature was a fiend or demon, you instead gain an amount equal to your Charisma modifier + twice your demon hunter level (minimum of 2).

### ???
*Prerequisite: Shattered Souls*

When you have temporary hit points gained from Shattered Souls, you have **[X benefit. Alternative: you regain 1 fel point when you do so.]**

### Torment
**[Deal psychic damage, force them to attack you.]**

**[Alternative/Additional option: can torture creatures for information.]**

# Update 3.0-preview-2

<br />

These are the changes made to the class since the last update released for the class (3.0.0).

### General
- Finished the Quick Build section.
- Warglaives have been moved to the equipment document. They are now martial weapons instead of their own category.
- Instead of Intelligence being their secondary ability score, demon hunters now use Charisma. All Intelligence-based abilities have been adjusted.
- Illidari Initiation has been reworked. The ambush and warglaive-focused abilities have been removed, instead adding demonic detection and anti-possession effects, as well as cosmetic mutations. Fel points have been placed inside this ability, using the blood hunter's Hunter's Bane as a premise.
- Fel Points have been reworked, with the demon hunter having half as many but being able to risk self-damage by pushing beyond this limit. The Demon's Bite, Empower Wards, and Momentum abilities have been removed.
- Chaos Blades have been added, based on the blood hunter's Crimson Rite and the chaos bolt spell. 
- Spectral Sight has been reworded and several abilities have been added on: the ability to cast *detect magic*, bonuses on seeing through visual illusions, anti-demon perception powers, and an x-ray vision ability at 9th level.
- Invocations have been added.
- Metamorphosis has been reworked and moved to 11th level.
- Fighting Styles have been added at 2nd level.
- Subclass abilities are now at levels 3/6/10/15/18 instead of 3/6/10/17.
- Instinctive Hunter, A Hunter Above All Else, Demon Wings, Illidari Finesse, Cleansed By Flames, and Abyssal Resilience have been removed.
- An alternate version of Empowered Wards has been added at 13th level.
- Revealing Gaze now also gives a passive blindsight.
- Timeless Body has been moved to 17th level and expanded into Immortal Soul.
- Prepared allows for a choice between two secondary benefits.

### To Be Determined
- Should Immortal Soul have alternate benefits?
- All of the Mark of Havoc and Mark of Vengeance subclass features.
- The level 15 ability for the Mark of Wrath subclass.
- The details of most of the invocations.
