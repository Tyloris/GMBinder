# Rebalanced Races for WC5E

This is an attempt to rebalance all the races so that they are equally powerful in terms of race points. The benchmark used is the WC5e night elf, which has 29 race points. This was done so that all races would get something rather than have something taken away. An exception to this is darkvision, which was too common, as well as some abilities that felt too repetitive.

## Worgen
Worgen are those who have been transformed by the worgen curse into creatures able to shift between man and beast. The vast majority of worgen are humans, with a smaller number of night elves and a handful of other races. 
### Worgen Traits
The worgen curse has transformed your body into that of a worgen. Using your Two Forms ability, you can revert to your pre-cursed form. Some traits only apply when you are in worgen form, some apply when you are in human form, and some apply at all times.

#### Universal Traits
The following traits apply to both of your forms.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength increases by 2, and your Dexterity increases by 1.

***Age.*** Worgen age like humans, but even though their bodies continue to age, they never feel the strain of old age, and continue to fight as if they were a young human. 

***Alignment.*** Worgen tend to become chaotic, while originating from humans, the infection of their blood with the wolves has made them more unpredictable. 

***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to the black nights, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Keen Senses.*** You gain proficiency in the Perception skill.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Low Common.

***Two Forms.*** Using 1 minute, you can transform yourself into a human. While human, you appear as you did before getting affected by the worgen curse. You always appear as the same human when you transform. You can transform back into a worgen as a free action on your turn.

As a human, you have Human Form traits and lose all worgen form traits, and vice versa. If you make an attack, cast a spell that affects an enemy creature, or try to use an ability only available in worgen form, you immediately revert into your worgen form. 

#### Human Form Traits
In your human form, you appear as you did before the curse. By repressing the inner beast, you have reclaimed some of the skills and abilities of your former life.

***Size.*** Like humans, they vary widely in height and build, depending on your heritage. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Human Resolve.*** When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die. You must use the new result, even if it is a 1.

***Racial Heritage.*** Choose a single kingdom from the human race to be your origin. You gain the racial abilities of that kingdom while in human form.

#### Worgen Form Traits 
While transformed into a worgen, the inner beast suppresses some of your skills and instead grants you bestial prowess.

***Size.*** Your worgen form is slightly larger than your human form, typically just under 7 or 8 feet tall.

***Speed.*** You base walking speed is 35 feet, and you have a climbing speed of 20 feet.

***Bite.*** Your fanged maw is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier.

***Natural Leaper.*** Your long jump distance is 30 feet and your high jump distance is 15 feet, with or without a running start.

***Thick Fur.*** You thick furred hide helps protect you. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.

> ##### Variant: Night Elf Worgen
> Some worgen come from the Druids of the Pack, a night elven druid circle that originated the worgen curse. In addition to having the Age and Languages ability of the night elven race, these worgen have the following traits while in their night elven form: Elusiveness, Shadowmeld, Ultravision, and a 35 foot movement speed.

### New Weapon Properties
***Returning.*** When you make a ranged attack with this weapon, it returns to your hand at the end of your turn unless you rolled a natural 1 on that attack roll. In that case, it lands in your target's space. 

***Strength.*** This weapon is extremely heavy. If you do not have the Powerful Build trait or a Strength score equal to the number in parenthesis, then you have disadvantage on attack rolls using the weapon and your speed is reduced by 10 feet.
