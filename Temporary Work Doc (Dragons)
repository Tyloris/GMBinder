## Dragons
Among the greatest of all living beings on the face of Azeroth, dragons are creatures who live up to their many legends. Their power is great as great as their beauty is majestic; a tremendous force to be reckoned with. 

Mature dragons are often larger than other creatures they might encounter, and their fangs and claws strong enough to destroy who might oppose them. To top it all off, most dragons are fortified further still with innate magical power. All of this taken into consideration, it is easy to see how their history is intricately twined with that of Azeroth itself -- in ways that few other beings can boast.

Their connection with the world is innate; born from both their heritage and from the power of the Dragon Aspects. With its first breath of life, a dragon will weave a bond with the world with the world around it, and when its death comes to pass it does so to a tremendous upheaval; causing earthquakes, floods, and suchlike.

Even young dragons, those who have not established as close a bond to the spiritual world, still make ripples in the fabric of reality when they die. Although these ripples are not always seen or felt by other races, they nonetheless garner the attention of other dragons.

### Dragon Lives

The life spans of dragons have not been accurately measured, but they are known to live for several centuries. A dragon begins its life as a **whelp** (or whelpling), growing from there in both size and power until it becomes a **drake** within five to ten years. After about a century or so, a drake reaches full maturity as a **dragon** -- before taking centuries therafter to become a **wyrm**.

### Interacting With Dragons
Each dragon is as individual as any mortal creature. They have their dreams, personality, quirks, and traits to make them stand out on their own. Still, there are a number of similarities that run through each dragonflight, and some that run through dragons as a whole. Some of these similarities are innate, others cultural, and others still drawn from painful lessons learned in ages past.

***Distant and Grand.*** Dragons interact with the mortal races with fair infrequency. They prefer the company of their own kind, or even complete isolation, to that of creatures whose lives can be measured in mere decades. In this light, if they do have to deal with mortals, they are often more inclined to interact with longer-lived races -- elves in particular, and often dwarves as well.

There is an exception to this tendency with the green and red dragonflights. Green dragons, as protectors of the natural world and the Emerald Dream, sometimes seek the aid of druids and their allies. Red dragons, in their part as protectors of life, are said to discreetly seek out mortals for the satisfaction of secretly living among them.

***Long Perspective.*** Whatever the situation, it is typical for a dragon to take a sometimes exceptionally long approach; content to seed events that may not see fruition for decades, or even centuries. As long as their lives can last, sometimes even reaching millennia, they are rarely wont for time to see their plans through to the end.

In the company of mortals, a dragon may very well forget that such creatures often prefer plans to take form in just a few years -- or even sooner, if possible!

### Dragonflights
Dragons are grouped together by type, referred to as dragonflights. There are only five true or "greater" dragonflights, each headed by a Dragon Aspect: black, blue, bronze, green, and red. From these have spawned at least three lesser dragonflights--infinite, netherwing, and twilight--who are the results of unnatural circumstances. All other dragons do not qualify as true dragonflights, though laymen sometimes refer to them as such.

### The Dragon Aspects
Long ago, the titan-forged Keeper Tyr stood against Galakrond; a tremendous,known as the Father of Dragons, who consumed other proto-dragons to increase his horrific power. It was only with the aid of five remarkable proto-dragons who stood by his side that Tyr was victorious.

These five proto-dragons were Alexstrasza, Malygos, Neltharion, Nozdormu, and Ysera. By the power of the Titans, they were each transformed into the first dragons and bestowed the title of Aspect.

They were immortal, given charge of each their own domain on Azeroth and the tremendous power to keep it. With them, other dragons who shared kinship with any of the five were held to the same charge. They would watch over all aspects of life with vigilance, feeling the weight of their responsibilities upon their very souls. 

In recent times, the Cataclysm and the destruction of Deathwing during the Hour of Twilight, saw the end of the Aspects' immortality -- as their charge to protect Azeroth had been fulfilled. Still, they remain present, and may yet aid Azeroth when a time of great need comes again.

### Dragons
As a dragon grows older, each stage of its life is distinctly unique from the last; not only growing larger, but also considerably more powerful. These stages are generally similar across all greater and lesser dragonflights.

#### Dragonwhelp
A dragonwhelp typically measures around 4 ft. from its snout to its tail as it emerges from its egg -- in which it has already been conscious for some time. Though physically weak, and thus rarely left alone, even a newly hatched whelp hold a significant magical aptitude.

#### Drake
It only takes a few years for a whelp to become a drake, a fairly explosive growth by any measure, before staying as such for decades to come. Given to their youth, drakes on their own can be quick to act; preferring swift and decisive action over the slow deliberation of their older kin. 

#### Dragon
By the time a drake has reached full maturity as a dragon, a century or more, it has had more than enough time to experience the world -- and to draw wisdom from it. Even among flights who keep close together, a mature dragon is very likely try and keep its own lair secluded.

#### Wyrm
Should a dragon live long enough, centuries down the line, it will eventually become a wyrm. They are the oldest and most venerable of their flight, keeping scores of dragons under their wings and within their domain, standing second only to the Aspects themselves. 






\columnbreak


### Dragonkin
There are other creatures that serve the dragonflights, usually under the command of older dragons and wyrms. Though they are not true dragons themselves, they all remain closely tied members of their respective flight.

How these creatures came to be is a well-guarded secret, known only to the dragons themselves; none of whom are particularly forthcoming with this information. 

#### Dragonspawn
The dragonspawn are monstrous beings trained to guard and to care for their respective dragonflight; acting as soldiers, assistants, or even companions. Just like the dragons themselves, they are endowed with a great number of virtuous qualities and mystic abilities.

Drawing comparisons to other creatures, they share similarities with centaurs -- having a lower body with four legs and a humanoid upper body with arms. Unlike centaurs however, they are lizard-like in every way; their bodies decked in scales. Some have been seen to have wings, though never large enough to permit flight.

#### Drakonid
The drakonid are typically described as half-man, half-dragon -- though just like with the dragonspawn, a dragon would never confirm whether there is anything to draw from this observation or if it is merely a coincidence.

They are towering creatures that walk on two legs, reaching far taller than any mortal that would cross their path, and make great use of their impressive strength in the work they do for the flight they serve.

### Greater Dragonflights
In ages past, when the largest of dragons, Galakrond, reigned over the land, scores of proto-dragons of countless colours flitted across the skies of ancient Kalimdor. Through time and change, few remain, and those that have stood the test of time and risen most to prominence are called the Greater Dragonflights, or Prime Dragonflights; blessed by the gods of Azeroth, the five flights - red, black, blue, bronze, and green - were charged with safeguarding Azeroth, and representing the fundamental forces of nature.

***The Dragon Aspects.*** Each of the dragonflights has a charge, a sacred duty, and among them no dragon exemplifies their role than the Dragon Aspect, each one empowered as an aspect of their granted domain, the ruler of their flight and typically the mother or father of most of it. These five dragons are the oldest, wisest and by far the most powerful of dragonkind, closer to gods than any other creature on Azeroth. They possess wisdom and memory aeons long, and seek nothing less than total peace across Azeroth, for the sake of her occupants and their own children.

***The Charge of the Dragonflights.*** Each dragonflight has been charged with an eternal duty, and each dragon within their birth flight possesses fantastic powers pertaining to their charge. Intelligent from the egg, each dragon takes their flight's charge extremely seriously, and it is a rare dragon that is not acting in their brood's best interests. Between flights there has been some contention, from derisive belief in other broods' "inferior" charges to competition, but the dragonflights collectively understand that, when all is done, their charge is for the good of Azeroth, not themselves.

#### Black Dragonflight
Where the other flights are kind, loyal or focused on Azeroth's protection, the black dragonflight are cruel, backstabbing and obsessed with the destruction of life, and toppling of kingdoms.

Long ago, the Black Dragonflight and its elder were charged with the protection over the Earth itself, and given a deep and intimate connection to Azeroth. In those days, the dragonflight were Azeroth's most ardent and stalwart defenders, able in one breath to extinguish and re-ignite a volcano, willing to go to any length to defend their friends, and eternally vigilant of corruption in the heart of Azeroth.

However, at the turn of an age, the Aspect of Earth was driven insane, and corrupted his entire brood with that same insanity. A war that ended in calamity for dragonkind cemented the Black Dragonflight's place as the betrayers, the dragons of death and evil, and enemies of all of Azeroth.

\columnbreak
#### Blue Dragonflight
Granted the grand task of watching over the realm of magic and enchantment across Azeroth, to ensure that the planet's latent powers are never abused, the Blue Dragonflight have perhaps the loftiest attitude towards their role, and perform it with feeling.

Almost driven to extinction at the advent of the Black Dragonflight's turn to evil, the blue flight is reclusive and secular, refusing any interaction with mortals with few exceptions and hoarding arcane knowledge and artifacts for themselves in their cultural home in Northrend. A blue dragon is an intensely intelligent, crafty being, inclined more towards riddles and puzzles than to combat and active duty. They take immense (and not unwarranted) pride in their skills and knowledge, and will take any chance possible to avail those nearby with their achievements.

#### Bronze Dragonflight
The bronze dragonflight was charged not over earth or magic, or any tangible thing; rather, they were charged to ensure that time passes as it should, that the future goes unaltered and that the past stays past. To this end, they were granted power over time itself, able to travel through the endless Caverns of Time to catch and halt those who would seek to change the past.

Due to their wide perspective and confusing travel between times, the bronzes are known to be extremely distant and out of tune with current events; indeed, they consider direct intervention to be only for the utmost of emergencies. Because of this, they are arguably the rarest seen of all dragons, although it is sometimes claimed that they are the most common users of mortal disguise.

#### Green Dragonflight
Ethereal and distant, the green dragonflight was charged with a role inextricably linked to all the others, but inevitably distinct; they and their leader were charged to watch over the Emerald Dream, and to uphold the life and soul of nature across Azeroth. Ever-sleeping, the emerald dragons have all but abandoned their worldly bodies that their spirits may watch over the Emerald Dream, the pristine and mystical mirror of the material world.  It is said that the greens may perceive both these realities at once, interwoven with one another.

Invariably kind spirited and gentle, these dragons will help those who seek to defend Azeroth whenever they can, though their means to do so on the material world are limited.

#### Red Dragonflight
Caring and gentle, though potentially fearsome and protective, the Red Dragonflight were charged to represent life itself in all its forms, but mortal life most of all. to them, all mortal creatures are like children to be protected, and the reds feel a deep obligation to see that the world's history progresses in such a way, though war and death will happen, that mortals are yet able to live and die as mortals, rather than as food to global threats, or fodder to cruel invasions.

Subsequently the red tend to be quite hands-off, preferring to interact with mortals - should they have to - in disguise, seeing that things are progressing smoothly. By preference, however, the ruby dragons will simply bide and live, keeping an eye open for greater threats, but otherwise content to let the world tick on as it should.

### Black Dragonflight
*"My blessing upon you will seem humble compared to those which have been bestowed upon the others: the managing of time, of life, of dreams and magic. I offer you the earth. The soil, the ground, the deep places. But know that the earth is the basis of all things. It is where we are rooted. Where you must come from, if you are to go to. Here is whence true strength comes. From deep places... within the world, and within oneself."*

<div style="text-align:Right">

*— Khaz'goroth's blessing of the Black Aspect*

</div>

<div style='margin-top:20px;'></div>

*"Silence! If you insist on calling it a gift, so be it. Know then what it is to be me, to be given this gracious gift... to feel the fiery heart of this world as your own. Know what it is to feel the weight of this dying world on your shoulders. Does the gift taste as sweet as you thought it would? This is what the other Aspects wish: to chain you to this world as I have been. To damn you to a life of eternal torment."*

<div style="text-align:Right">

*— The Black Aspect, Deathwing*

</div>

Black scales, the deepest colors of onyx and ebony; eyes that burn red with the flame within, and a similar crimson glow visible deep within their throat when they give a mighty roar; black dragons are a sight to behold. Charged with the protection of the earth, and bearers of its strength, the black dragonflight is one of great power.

***Defenders of Azeroth.*** For a time, black dragons were once defenders of Azeroth. They shaped the lands, created mountains and valleys, and represented the strength of the earth. For millennia they defended Azeroth from destruction, until they fell from grace.

***Corrupted Champions.*** At an unknown point, whisperings of the Old Gods corrupted the black dragons, especially their Aspect and leader, Neltharion. During the War of the Ancients, Neltharion was instrumental in the creation of the Dragon Soul; this was ostensibly to defeat the Burning Legion, but Neltharion used it to betray his allies.

With the Legion all but defeated, Neltharion turned the Dragon Soul on the night elves and dragons who had been his allies. Only the timely arrival of Korialstrasz, consort of the red dragonqueen, saved them all from certain death.

***Enemies of Azeroth.*** The betrayal was so great that the other dragonflights never truly recovered, and the ensuing war between dragons further damaged the species. Black dragons were hunted down and nearly annihilated, their numbers reduced to very few. From that point forward they served as infrequent but deadly threats to all.

During much of this time, Neltharion — now called Deathwing — was rarely seen. After a series of setbacks and a defeat at the hands of the other Aspects, he retreated to Deepholm in the Elemental Plane. Many thought he was defeated forever, but they were very wrong.

***Cataclysmic Threat.*** After the fall of the Lich King, Deathwing made his return. He fractured the World Pillar, which caused the Cataclysm and reshaped much of the surface of Azeroth. He and the black dragonflight brought the world to its knees, but were ultimately defeated by brave heroes. At their side fought Wrathion, an uncorrupted black dragonwhelp who represented hope for the future.

### Blue Dragonflight

*"I believe that you will find that my gift to you is not just a profound duty — which it is — but also a delight — which it is! Magic must be regulated, managed, and controlled. But it must also be appreciated and valued and not hoarded. Such is the contradiction you must deal with. May you be dutiful... and joyous both."*

<div style="text-align:Right">

— *Norgannon's blessing of the Blue Aspect*

</div>

Wreathed in swirls and eddies of snow-dusted air, blue dragons are covered in lustrous scales of azure blue and silvery white. The air around them is often cold. Magic is the domain of the blue dragonflight; they are charged with its use and care, for the power of magic is not to be taken lightly.

***Tending the Arcane.*** Led by the Aspect Malygos, and his mate Sindragosa, the blue dragonflight tended arcane magic for millennia. Native to the northern reaches that would one day become Northrend, they conducted many experiments. They even discovered other realms of existence, and spent much time watching over those who practiced magic.

***Betrayal and Death.*** During the War of the Ancients, the blue dragonflight was betrayed. When Deathwing used the Dragon Soul to turn on his allies, he all but wiped out the blue dragons. Malygos — overwhelmed by the loss of his mate, his friend Neltharion, and most of his kin — fell into a grief-stricken madness. The few blue dragons who remained, and a few remaining blue dragon eggs, were the flight's only hope for the future.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:30px;'></div>

    ***The Nexus War.*** Some while after the defeat of Illidan, Malygos seemed to wake from his madness. He concluded that the mortal races had caused too much destruction with their reckless pursuit of power. He and the newly resurgent blue flight declared war on the Kirin Tor and began to siphon the magic of Azeroth, so that it could not be misused, but this had destructive effects on the world. Their efforts became so destructive that Alexstrsza and the other aspects saw no other course but to destroy Malygos.

***Spread to the Winds.*** No other dragonflight at that time had ever suffered the death of an Aspect. Leaderless, and without the guiding power of the Aspect in whom had been placed the power over arcane magic, the blue dragonflight was devastated once again. With the final destruction of Deathwing, this became a moot point, as the Aspects lost their immortality and much of their power.

Their numbers reduced yet again, lacking an Aspect, the blue dragonflight effectively dissolved. Blue dragons went their own way, each choosing their home and their goals as they saw fit. Most retained the dragonkin that were already in their service, but kept little contact with one another.

### Bronze Dragonflight
*"Unto you is charged the great task of keeping the purity of time. Know that there is only one true timeline, though there are those who would have it otherwise. You must protect it. Without the truth of time as it is meant to unfold, more will be lost than you can possibly imagine. The fabric of reality will unravel. It is a heavy task — the base of all tasks of this world, for nothing can transpire without time."*

<div style="text-align:Right">

— *Aman'Thul's blessing of the Bronze Aspect*

</div>

Adorned in scales of glimmering bronze, which often seem to shimmer like a mirage in the desert heat, bronze dragons are a majestic sight to behold. Massive wings blot out the sun, their eyes burn with magical intensity, and one has a sense of impending time in their presence. Encountering a bronze dragon is very rare, and always portends great events.

***Guardians of Time.*** Bronze dragons were gifted — and burdened — with power over the passage of time. They were able to see the past and the future with perfect clarity, and in so doing they could identify any unnatural branches from the established timeline. When great powers threatened to change the past to their benefit, or alter the course of events for a future that could be controlled, bronze dragons were there to thwart those plans. They performed their duty with diligence and honor for an Age, until Neltharion's betrayal of dragonkind.

***Hunted to All Corners.*** After Deathwing betrayed his own kind, he attempted to subjugate the bronze dragonflight. This would not come to pass, as Nozdormu — the Timeless One, Aspect of the bronze dragonflight — saw to it that his kin scattered to the distant corners of Azeroth. From there, they maintained their endless vigil over the proper timeline.

***War in the Desert.*** Though bronze dragons are not often likely to become involved in mortal affairs, they became embroiled in the War of the Shifting Sands, over a thousand years ago. Initially unwilling to help the night elves battle the Qiraji, their attitude changed when the spreading conflict threatened the Caverns of Time. Nozdormu and his kin joined in the fight, and even enlisted the aid of the other major dragonflights. After locking the danger away in Ahn'Qiraj, they returned to their seclusion.

***Destroying the Demon Soul.*** They joined mortal affairs again during the Second War, specifically the Battle of Grim Batol. When faced with Deathwing and his minions once again, Nozdormo was finally convinced to throw the bronze dragonflight into the conflict. Along with the other dragons, they saw the destruction of the Demon Soul which locked away some of the Aspects' power, and forced Deathwing into retreat once again. With Nozdormu restored to his former strength, he and the bronze dragons once again took a more active role in the world.

***Loss of the Sight.*** After the Cataclysm, when dragons gathered to battle Deathwing one final time, the bronze dragonflight was not absent. They took their place in Wyrmrest Accord and joined in the fight, but with the destruction of Deathwing and the fulfillment of the Aspects' purpose, much was lost. Nozdormu and the other bronze dragons retained much of their power, but lost their sight of the true timeline, as well as direct control over it.

### Green Dragonflight

*"You are bound to the waking Dream of Creation. Nature is your realm, and all things have caught glimpses of the Emerald Dream when they sleep. You see them all, Ysera. And they see you, though they may not know it. Like the Life-Binder, you touch all living beings, and sing to them the songs of creation and interconnectedness."*

<div style="text-align:Right">

— *Eonar's blessing of the Green Aspect*

</div>

The green dragonflight consists of dragons adorned with vibrant, green scales -- earning them their second moniker as the *Emerald Dragonflight*. 

During the ordering of Azeroth, the titan Eonar charged Ysera and her flight with upholding the natural balance of both Azeroth and the Emerald Dream; a pristine spirit-realm of nature and magic that exists far beyond the boundaries of the physical world. It is through this charge that the green dragons keep their affinity for the wilds.

***Protectors of Nature.*** When dealing with mortals, green dragons primarily only come into conflict with those who would attempt to corrupt or destroy nature. In this sense, much like the red dragons, they are among the most approachable of the dragonflights. To this end, they have many a time sought the help of druids to aid in their task, and to this day keep a close connection with such groups -- the Cenarion Circle in particular.

***Solitary Lives.*** Given the task placed upon them and their ties to the Emerald Dream, it is not surprising that green dragons highly reclusive; exceedingly difficult for mere mortals to find on their own. They are peaceful, meditative, and said to be spending most of their time in slumber and quiet contemplation. 

\columnbreak

***Seeding the Great Trees.*** Following the Great Sundering at the end of the War of the Ancients, the green Dragon Aspect Ysera played part in seeding a colossal tree within the new Well of Eternity. The tree became known as Nordrassil, the Crown of the Heavens -- and with its branches as saplings, several more trees were scattered across Azeroth. 

These were the Great Trees, five of them in total. They were not planted with Ysera's approval, however, nor did they receive her blessing as Nordrassil once had. And so, as the trees came to tower over the lands, their roots dug deep, one tree fell an ill fate. In Northrend, the great tree Andrassil had reached deep enough into the earth to touch the subterranean prison of Yogg'saron. 

***The Seeping Nightmare.*** As Yogg'saron touched the roots of Andrassil, without the dragons' protection, corruption quickly seeped into the tree. Though it was a heartbreaking task for the druids of the Cenarion Circle, the tree was destroyed -- renamed Vordrassil, the Broken Crown -- and the corruption thought stopped. 

The Great Trees would all act as portals; each one an anchoring point for the druids and green dragons alike to travel between Azeroth and the Emerald Dream, as well as a grove under the dragonflight's protection. 

Unknown to them all, however, was the darkness that had already taken root within the Emerald Dream. Yogg'saron, and the other Old Gods with it, used the Great Trees to allow their influence to reach beyond the mortal world. Heralded by a corrupting mist that spread out across the land, and by its eponymous Nightmare Lord, swathes of the Dream were twisted beyond any resemblance of its verdant self and corrupted into a waking Nightmare.

### Red Dragonflight

*"This is my gift: compassion for all living things. A drive to protect and nurture them. And the ability to heal that which others cannot, birth what others may not, and love even the unlovable -- who surely need such grace more than any other souls."*

<div style="text-align:Right">

— *Eonar's blessing of the Green Aspect*

</div>

Borne across the sky on ruby wings, the red dragonflight are feared and revered for their fiery breath -- which has been gifted the power both to bring life and to take it away. They are led by Alexstrasza, the Life-Binder, whose duty was given to her by the titan Eonar. 

***Protectors of Life.*** It is not without reason that the red dragonflight consider themselves custodians of mortal life. In many ways, their claim is true; for they are often the chosen wardens of places and artifacts whose powers might spell doom for lesser beings. Wherever a red dragon walks or breathes upon the earth, its soil is renewed, lush and vibrant with life.

***Mortal Ambassadors.*** With the exception of the green dragonflight's ties to the druids of the Cenarion Circle, if a mortal were to encounter a dragon -- whether knowingly or not -- it's most likely that dragon would hail from the red dragonflight. It is common among all dragons to keep tabs on mortal races, especially their sprawling cities and important figures, none of the other flights would do so as openly as the red dragonflight often has.

***The Queen of Dragons.*** Perhaps even greater than her role as the Life-Binder, Alexstrasza of the red dragonflight also holds the title of Dragon Queen. She, along with her consorts, receives the greatest reverence even among the other dragonflights, and her compassion for the mortal races of Azeroth is beyond equal. 

It is her firmly held belief that only a few are ever truly evil, and that even those who are may not yet be beyond redemption. After all, the power to change and to grow is inherent in all life, whether it chooses to seek light or steep itself in darkness. 

***The Dragons and the Dragonmaw.*** During the Second War, the orc shaman Zuluhed of the Dragonmaw clan received visions of a powerful artifact hidden away within the depths of the earth -- the Demon Soul. In the hands of Zuluhed's lieutenant, Nekros Skullcrusher, the Dragonmaw clan wielded the power of the Demon Soul to track down and enslave scores of the red dragonflight; including the Life-Binder Alexstrasza herself.

For eight agonizing years, the Queen of Dragons was kept prisoner by the Dragonmaw clan, deep within the halls of Grim Batol; an ancient and abandoned dwarven fortress the orcs had seized as their base of operations. There, the orcish Horde raised her offspring as devastating weapons of war for their swelling ranks of dragon riders. 

***The Battle of Grim Batol.*** Even after the defeat of the Horde at the end of the Second War, the Dragonmaw clan remained undefeated at Grim Batol and Alexstrasza remained their prisoner. It was then that a small band of resistance fighters from the Alliance -- led by the human mage Rhonin -- managed to infiltrate the ancient fortress in an effort to free the Dragon Queen. 

A great battle ensued; one in which the Aspects clashed with the fallen Earth-Warder, before the Demon Soul was shattered and the orcs routed. Once the dragons could take wing again, they returned to their old charge as protectors, though their wounds would take a long time to heal.

### Lesser Dragonflights
Outside of the five greater dragonflights exists a number of outliers; all true dragons, with all the vast power and intellect that implies, but each of them outside of the charge of the Titans that has long empowered them.

These lesser dragonflights are all connected in some way to the five true flights, but each is distinct and unique in their own regard, eking out a place in the world that separates them from the true dragonflights. For better or worse, these lesser dragonflights are races unto themselves, and can be as if not more dangerous than the prime dragonflights.
 
#### Infinite Dragonflight
Appearing as invasive forces throughout the timeways as twisted inverses of the bronze dragonflight, the mysterious infinite dragonflight appear to their bronze foes as insane and extremely dangerous terrorists threatening the flows of history itself.

The infinite flight traverse history, appearing through hijacked timeways at important moments in history to disrupt and change the passage of time, seeking to avert some distant future that they consider unfavourable. Their origin is unknown, as are their motivations or base of operations; all that is known is that they are a threat to all of time, and the enemy to all life.

***The Infinite Aspect.*** Seemingly equal in power to the five true Dragon Aspects is the mysterious, unseen leader of the infinite flight. From a distant, broken, locked future timeline, this dragon of immense power directs the rest of their flight to influence past events with zealous fervour, as though desperate to change the future.
 
#### Netherwing Dragonflight
The netherwing dragonflight were born from black dragon eggs brought by Deathwing onto the orc homeworld Draenor -- shortly before it was destroyed. As the calamity tore the planet asunder, the volatile powers of the Twisting Nether saw the eggs hatch into shimmering, translucent beings; half there, half not.

Now fairly numerous, these world-weary dragons have lived hard lives since Outland's collapse, facing threats of enslavement or extinction at the hands of orcs and demons, before seeing their rapid lives burn out like too-bright stars in the dim sky. Like much else in Outland, they live lives of tragedy; nasty, brutish and short lives marred by the irony of their own creation, as dragons that were meant to be stockpiles of black eggs, and ended up being close to nothing at all.

They are wary of the world around them, and mistrusting of strangers, but the bonds they create with the few mortals they trust are eternal, and forged by dragonfire; for although they are composed of wild energy, dragons they are, and they are pleased to be recognized as such.
 
\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:30px;'></div>

#### Twilight Dragonflight
The culmination of years of study and experimentation by the consort to Deathwing, Sintharia, the twilight flight was crafted from the blood of all flights for one purpose alone; they are superweapons, vitriolic masses of unstable energy in dragon form that are able to release overwhelming power upon the foes of their masters, the black dragonflight. Their very existence is chaos, their bodies radiating the same twisted energies that saw their creation as they shift back and forth between the material world and a harrowing plane of existence known as the Realm of Twilight.

The greatest danger in encountering these creatures is their uncontrollable nature. Though they are loyal to Deathwing, they are prone to cowardice, outbursts and mockery when placed in the command of anyone else. This, combined with the extremely unstable nature of their bodies, makes being around one a dangerous risk even for allies. When they die, and even sometimes when they do not, their bodies are known to suddenly and violently explode with life-extinguishing energy, taking with them a sizeable chunk of the environment.

> ##### Chromatic Dragonflight
> One of Nefarion's earliest experiments was attempting to condense the powers of the five greater dragonflights into a single creation, to be known as the chromatic dragonflight. These experiments were largely considered failures; many whelps died before hatching, and those that survived were unstable, short-lived, volatile, and/or deformed. One of the very few successes of these experiments was the drakeadon, a semi-draconic beast.

### Infinite Dragonflight
*"You crawl unwitting, like a blind, writhing worm, towards endless madness and despair. I have witnessed the true End Time. This? This is a blessing you simply cannot comprehend."*

<div style="text-align:Right">

*- Murozond the Infinite*

</div>

The cruel and enigmatic Infinite Dragonflight are the inverse of the wise Bronze flight. Where the Bronze seek to maintain the flow of time and ensure that past events remain as they are, while trying to learn from their glimpses of the future, the Infinite flight seek to disrupt and change the course of history, appearing amongst major events from times past and altering them through trickery or brute force. Their motivations are cloudy, and their origins are a secret hidden in the ages - or in the distant future.

***Negative Image.*** They appear as eye-watering negatives of their bronze foes, their colours and bodies altered by their drastic meddling with the timeflow, with scales in metallic greys and blues. Their hides appear cracked and bleed out glowing energy instead of blood. Their voices almost seem to come from all directions, and echo in a disjointed manner, and when they move they almost seem to be unsynchronised with events around them - their shadows may lag behind for a moment, or their breath attack may scorch the earth before the flames touch it.

***Time Bandits.***  The Infinites have only one apparent goal - changing the outcomes of major historical events to change the future. To do so they aggressively create tears in time, before using disguise and  subterfuge to subtly change events. They may mislead a major leader, or assassinate a king, or simply change several minor details and invoke the butterfly effect. When things do not go according to plan, however, they throw subtlety away and engage in all-out dragon combat, uncaring of the consequences across time.

***Ebb and flow.*** In response to these threats, the Bronze Dragonflight have been in a constant state of cat and mouse with the Infinites. Never able to identify their base of operations, with only smatterings of knowledge about their leadership, the Bronze have found that they are unable to do direct interference with the Infinites - partly due to their own nature, but also because the Infinites seem to know everything about the Bronze. Their methods, their weaknesses, their powers - and the Infinites are far less scrupulous with collateral damage. As such, the Bronze must frequently collaborate with adventurers, and sending them into the past through the Caverns of Time.

***Lost time.*** The origins of the Infinites are unclear. However, among their ranks, some familiar names have been heard. It has been suggested that the Infinites may have once been Bronze dragons who became disillusioned with the duty of their flight, or perhaps who entered the timeways and became lost or confused. Others suggest that the Infinites may be dark reflections of real dragons created from alternative universes, of which thousands are created and destroyed each second. In truth, their origins may remain a mystery as old as time.

### Netherwing Dragonflight

*"You were once a chief lieutenant, Mor'ghor. Your work in Grim Batol is not easily forgotten. Now... We need the eggs that you recovered. The Netherwing eggs. They are, after all, a product of the master. We will pay whatever price that you ask."*

<div style="text-align:Right">

*- Sintharia*

</div>

The Netherwing Dragonflight live in the shadow of many sordid events. Spawned of the Black Dragonflight as eggs laid by Deathwing's own consort, they were cursed before they even hatched when they were hidden by their father on Draenor - shortly before the orc homeworld's destruction. As a result of the twisting shadowy energy upon their embryonic bodies, upon hatching they were found to be a new creature entirely; one that exists in a state of unreality, half there and half not.

Deep purples, blues and greens - the colours of the  Twisting Nether - emblazon Netherwing populations, their translucent bodies and shadowy skin seeming smooth and flush. Their faces are more like that of a shark than a reptile. They are of few words, what little they say tends to be sombre. 

Living in the nether-torn reaches of Outland, the Netherwing Flight have propagated and forged a life for themselves, facing off threats at every angle, from slavery to extinction, while being forced to accept the facts of their own half-existence.

***Nether born.*** Hatched in the swirling energies of a dying planet, the Netherwing dragons can be said to be only half-real. Creatures fighting them may find that their attacks simply phase through the dragons' bodies. Their very presence will burn away at the very being of anybody unfortunate enough to be near them, and their very breath is formed of the arcane energies of the Twisting Nether. Due to the instability of their bodies, they grow into adult hood rapidly, and then burn their lives away at extreme speed, fading away like dying stars. 

***Dragonmaw mounts.*** The remnants of the unscrupulous Dragonmaw Claon in Outland have a history of capturing, enslaving and breaking dragons into beasts of war, and as the only dragons native to Outland, the Netherwing are no different. Bound in the name of Illidan Stormrage, the dragons faced a choice of enslavement or death. 

***Dark energies.*** The magic within their bodies and their eggs is considered valuable by those interested in such things, and the devious methods that utilise this magic never result in a living Nether dragon. The corruptive power within their unstable bodies has been seen to alter and transform those flooded with it, while their eggs have been used as a stepping stone in the creation of even darker species.

### Twilight Dragonflight

*"I am the beginning of the end...the shadow which blots out the sun...the bell which tolls your doom. For this moment ALONE was I made. Look upon your death, mortals, and despair!"* 

<div style="text-align:Right">

*- Ultraxion*

</div>

Into the Twilight Dragonflight, the black dragon Aspect Deathwing placed all of his hatred and seething desire to see life put to an end. Into their bodies he placed the atrophic power of pure destruction, the power sufficient to end all life. Into their minds he placed only anger and jealousy, mixed with pride enough to eclipse any other. In the Twilight flight Deathwing had his perfect weapons.

Their deep purple bodies, at times semi-translucent, pulse and hum with overwhelming amounts of energy. Their extremely unstable forms fluctuate, and their mere presence warps and alters magic around them.  Though physically powerful, their true strength is in their powers over their twilight magic, able to tap into a mysterious Twilight Realm to facilitate their unmaking of their master's foes.

***Experiments Completed.*** Through his children and mate's failed work creating the Netherwing and Chromatic dragons, Deathwing saw the path to success in his grand plan - a race of dragonkin subservient to him that exist only to destroy. A symbol of his future dominion over dragonkind, and weapon to bring it to fruition. To Deathwing, his family's failures made them less than nothing - the Twilight Flight was his success, and his alone.

***Unstable Horrors.*** Twilight dragons are extremely unstable, being flooded with considerably more energy than their bodies can handle. It is common for weakened Twilight dragons to spontaneously explode, causing significant destruction even in death. Even when intact, their bodies constantly arc out with devastating energy, which can ground itself on unfortunate adventurers unfortunate enough to act as a conduit. 

***Twilight Realm.*** The dragons of this flight are able to tap into, and even transport themselves to, a mysterious place they call the Twilight Realm. Nothing is known of this place other than that no light enters it. There is no sun in the sky, no flames to light the way, and no hope for any mortal trapped within.

***Displaced loyalty.*** The twilight dragons are fully and exclusively loyal to Deathwing, and when made to ally themselves with others of Deathwing's servants, they make clear their distaste in no small amount. It is rare that a grown twilight dragon of any renown would ever consider dying to save another, unless expected to by Deathwing himself.

## Elemental Drakes

Elementals, the ancient proto-beings of a young world, take many forms.

First seen by mortal eyes during the Cataclysm of Azeroth, elemental drakes were quite a surprise to enterprising adventurers. Powerful elementals taking a form identical to the great dragons of Azeroth, the elemental drakes of Deepholm and Skywall - elemental realms of Earth and Air respectively - represent only a fraction of the elemental world, and yet their very existence is a mystery.

Enormous and deadly elemental predators, elemental drakes patrol their territories in their elemental homes without thought or agenda - they lack the deep and ancient intellect that true dragons possess, and instead live as powerful elemental beasts. Through their connection to their mother element, they demonstrate much of the power and danger seen in fleshy dragons, with powerful elemental breath and hurricane force within their wings - however, their animal instinct makes them impossible to reason with, and their size and habits make them far more dangerous than many other elementals, most of which are intelligent and sometimes not immediately hostile.

In their elemental realms, these dragons have been seen fulfilling natural roles, but in the hands of more intelligent beings - higher elementals, cultists or cruel shamans - they have been subjugated into guards and mounts. This smuggling of drakes did not go unnoticed by the elementals of their home realms, but in the case of Deepholm, nobody much cared; in the case of Skywall, many of them were gifts by Ak’akir, the Windlord, to loyal followers. In all cases, these dragons did not adapt well to foreign climates, and none are seen naturally across Azeroth.

***Draconic Origins.*** The elemental drakes represent an historian's conundrum; they appear to have existed for aeons uninterrupted, locked away from Azeroth since creation, and yet they are identical in almost every way to contemporary dragons. It is not known how this could have happened, but it is possible that these animalistic elementals are the oldest common ancestor to modern dragons, and as such, elemental drakes may be the precursor to all draconic life on Azeroth. The truth, of course, is unknown - elementals are not forthcoming with details, and the drakes cannot speak.

### Stone Drakes

The stalwart stone drakes found in Deepholm, the elemental plane of the Earth, were the first elemental drakes to be seen by mystified mortals. Undisturbed for aeons, generations of these drakes had hatched, lived, hunted, bred and died across the shelves of higher Deepholm, of which they have near-total domination, as the only true high-flying elementals of the realm. There they hunt the few fleshy creatures to be found in the elemental plane. They appear to be unconcerned with elemental matters; they follow only the strongest broodmother in a colony, and otherwise do not obey the word of shamans, or even of the Stonemother, Therazane.

***Stone Nature.*** Their skins are solid rock, studded with gemstone growths, crystalline spines and horns, and wings webbed with mineral filament. They are exceptionally, impossibly heavy, and yet their flight seems effortless. This is yet another mystery of the elemental drakes.

> ##### Variant: Precious Stones
> There are as many types of stone drakes as their are varieties of stone. Some drakes take after certain varieties, changing their breath weapons to take on one of the following properties:
> 
> **Phosphorescent.** The drake spews radiation, dealing necrotic damage and causing those who fail their saving throws to gain one level of exhaustion, and they must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or contract the radiation disease (Manual of Monsters page ###).
>
> **Sandstone.** The drake exhales a gust of sand, dealing slashing damage and blinding those who fail their saving throws until the end of the drake's next turn.
>
> **Slate.** The drake's breath weapon is a gust of stone dust, dealing no damage and requiring a Constitution saving throw instead. Each creature in the area who fails their save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends on the target. On a failure, the target is petrified until freed by the *greater restoration* spell or other magic.
>
> **Vitreous.** The drake unleashes a hail of sharp crystal shards, becoming a line 5 feet wide and twice as long as their original breath weapon. The attack deals piercing damage and those who fail their saving throw have their bodies embedded with small shards of volcanic glass. Each time they move more than half their speed, they take 2 (1d4) piercing damage from the shards. The shards can be removed with the *lesser restoration* spell or a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
>
> **Volcanic.** The drake exhales a jet of lava, dealing fire damage instead. In addition, the area hit by the lava becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, they take 5 (1d10) fire damage.

### A Stone Drake's Lair
Stone drake lairs are located in the immense caverns of Deepholm, where they can take full advantage of their flight abilities. Typically they nest near confluences of geomagnetic energies, often marked by veins of lava or forests of crystal shards.

### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the drake can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

- Stalactites fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the drake can see within 120 feet of it. The drake makes one ranged attack roll (+9 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.

### Storm Drakes 
In Skywall, the kingdom of clouds occupied by air elementals, the elemental storm drakes drift lazily across the endless sky, held aloft by the myriad wind currents that make up their home. Only seldom do they leave the clouds, let alone land on their feet. Their sleek, pearlescent scales seem almost textureless, like glass, but their stormy moods and the hurricane force of their wings are more than tangible.

***Stormguard.*** Storm drakes are utilized by the cunning elementals of air as guardians of the few constructed temples in Skywall, through subjugation and cruel magic. Here the drakes demonstrate a powerful and abiding territorial nature, enforcing hurricane force winds to drive away enemies - usually opposing elementals seeking to off a political foe, though more recently landbound adventurers have found just how dangerous these winds can be.

> ##### Variant: The Four Winds
> Some drakes show an affinity for the winds of one of the four cardinal directions. Their breath weapon changes to reflect this, gaining one of the following properties:
> 
> ***Breath of the North Wind.*** The drake's breath becomes wintry, dealing cold damage and causing creatures who fail their saving throw to have their movement speed reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. In addition, the area affected by the breath weapon becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute due to leftover sleet.
>
> ***Breath of the East Wind.*** The drake's breath becomes that of a storm-force gale, extinguishing unprotected fires, dispersing vapors and gas, and causing creatures who fail their saving throw to be pushed back up to the far range of drake's breath weapon. 
>
> ***Breath of the South Wind.*** The drake's breath becomes laced with a thunderstorm, dealing lightning damage and causing those who fail their saving throw to become deafened for 1 minute.
>
> ***Breath of the West Wind.*** The drake's breath carries the scent of pollen and toxic spores. Creatures who fail their saving throw become poisoned until the beginning of the drake's next turn.

### A Storm Drake's Lair
A storm drake's lair is a location within Skywall, typically where at least two of the four winds meet. As such locations are typically locations of settlements, ancient storm drakes often are subjugated under the rule of a powerful djinn.

### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the drake can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
- A lightning bolt touches down at a point the drake chooses within 120 feet. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures wearing armor made of metal have disadvantage on this saving throw.

>
> ***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.
>
> ***Gust.*** One target within 10 feet must make a DC 20 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 13 (3d8) bludgeo­ning damage and is flung up to 30 feet directly away from the drake and knocked prone. If the saving throw is successful, the target only takes half damage and isn't flung away or knocked prone.
>
> ***Breath of the Four Winds (Recharge 5-6).*** The drake exhales strong winds in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 72 (16d8) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

- A series of small twisters fills the area within a 60-foot radius of the drake. Each creature in the area other than the drake must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked 1d6 x 10 feet straight up into the air, taking fall damage as normal.
- The drake creates an area of strong wind in the shape of a 40-foot radius sphere centered on it. The wind moves in a single direction, such as north or west, chosen by the drake. Each creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet in the direction of the wind. Any creature in the area must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves against the wind, while movement speed in the direction of the wind is doubled. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished. The wind remains centered on the drake and lasts it uses this lair action again or until it dies.

## The Plague
*"Be wary, child, of Plaguelands plain... <br/>
Be mindful, child, of the infected grain... <br/>
For if throat is parched and of infected water sip... <br/>
Forever your soul will be in cursed Scourge grip. <br/>
So heed this warning, child, and if far from mother stray... <br/>
Let light from home's hearth guide you back your way."*

### Plagued Dragons

Beneath the earth in the dread catacombs of Scholomance, the Cult of the Damned performed sick and twisted experiments on the living. Even dragons were not exempt, as the Cult had "procured" some Black Dragonflight eggs, and had begun efforts to create a living dragonflight worthy of the Scourge.

Sickly green in hue and diseased from the egg, constantly covered in sores and festering wounds, these insane creatures know only suffering and pain, which they seek only to inflict upon others. Through their blighted breath they flood their foes with sickness, spreading the dreaded Plague of Undeath to the living.

***Infant mortality.*** As the Cult has learned, deathly disease causes the rapid end of life, and as such most of these foul creatures have died before they could reach adulthood. Those that do not may also become so unstable or sick that they are simply unable to function. Indeed, a great portion of the experiments - and why the Cult constantly needs new eggs - have been devoted to working out how to extend the dragonwhelps' lives, and suffering, further. 

***Affront to life.*** No people of morality or goodwill may sleep soundly knowing these creatures are alive and suffering, and some groups have devoted their time to eliminating this experiment for good. Unfortunately, they realise that the only way to end the experiment is to end Scholomance itself, a task sought out only by the most powerful among Azeroth's defenders.

##### Plague of Undeath
While there have been several plagues throughout history, in general when someone mentions "*the* plague," they are referring to the Plague of Undeath, a deadly necromantic disease that ravaged most of the Eastern Kingdoms during the Third War. 

The Plague affects species differently. The original Plague almost exclusively killed humans and caused them to rise as zombies and other undead, while some flora and fauna were infected and sprouted plague-filled growths. The New Plague developed by certain Forsaken apothecaries could even kill the undead Scourge. Other variants have existed, developed in alchemical labs and necromancy cabals.

> ##### Plagued Creature Template
> Poison Splash. When the troll takes damage of any type but psychic, each creature within 5 feet of the troll takes 9 (2d8) poison damage.
>
> Virulent -- poison ignores poison immunity
>
> Undead Fortitude



The plague of undeath is a blanket term used to refer to several types When a creature is exposed to a source of the plague--such as through breathing spores, ingesting grain, or an open wound--they must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or contract

> ***Plague of Undeath.*** It takes 1d4 days for the plague’s symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Infected react differently — symptoms range from fatigue, nausea, fever, to minor hallucinations. Humans are particularly vulnerable to the disease and have disadvantage on saving throws against it. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.
> 
> At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the creature’s exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature’s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.
>
> If a creature dies from exhaustion while under this disease, it rises as an uncontrolled zombie 24 hours later. If raised as an undead by a different spell, the spell requires no material components.

> ##### Radiation Disease
> When an uninfected creature comes into contact with a source of radiation — such as contaminated water, being bitten by an infected creature, or for every hour spent in a high-radiation area — the creature must succeed on a DC 11 a Constitution saving throw or contract the radiation disease.
>
> It takes 1d4 days for the disease to manifest. As it does, the creature's skin takes on a sickly green tint and abscesses start to spread across its surface. At the end of that period, the creature gains advantage on saving throws against poison and resistance against poison damage. However, the creature also has disadvantage on all Strength and Dexterity ability checks, as well as weapon attack rolls.
>
> Once a creature has carried the radiation disease for more than two weeks, its skin turns completely green. It no longer suffers from disadvantage on ability checks or weapon attacks, but it gains an indefinite madness as described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* (p. 260).
>
> The radiation symptoms can be cured by a spell, such as *lesser restoration*. Once the disease has manifested, a more potent spell such as *greater restoration* or *heal* is required.

## Storm Dragons

In mountainous Stormheim, the half-giant Vrykul both revere and fear the mighty Storm Drakes, who rule the skies and the mountaintops as uncontested kings.

Deep purple or red scales laced with wild electricity, wings like shocks of thunder, and slim, lean bodies characterise these mysterious cousins to the true Dragonflights. Little is known of them, other than their undisputed mastery of Stormhein's stormy skies, but it is known that they are noble and considerate creatures... to those they consider worthy.

***Noble Cousins.*** The storm drakes appear unrelated to the five great Dragonflights, and were given no charge, blessing, nor obligations by the Titans. Nevertheless, they hold in their hearts the noble strength and will of dragonkind, and to the Vrykul of Stormheim they are close to divine, acting as respected protectors of Vrykul tradition. 

***Flight Divided.*** These are several broods of storm drakes, each loyal to their brood mother. These broods display differing loyalties and intentions, forging their own alliances, rivalries and intentions independent of one another. While some may protect Stormheim's occupants, others may believe themselves above such things and claim land as their own, and its people as food. As such, the vrykul below them are always ready with offerings - or harpoons.

>
> ***Cyclone Winds.***  Whenever the dragon uses its wing attack, as a bonus action it can create a small cyclone around one creature within 30 feet of it. The creature must succeed a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, or be grappled until the dragon's next turn.
>
> ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The dragon's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
> 
> At will: *detect magic*, ✦ *lighting blast*, *resistance*, <br/>     *thunderclap* ^XGE^

> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) lighting damage.
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.
>
> ***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 15ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
>
> ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
>
> ***Lighting Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon exhales lighthing in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 38 (11d6) lighting damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
<br/>    In addition, any creature damaged by the lighting breath must succeed a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed until the end of the dragon's next turn.
>
> ***Change Shape.*** The dragon can magically polymorph into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (its choice). 
> <br/>    In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.
>
>
> ### Legendary Actions
> The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
>
> **Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) 
<br/>    check.
> <br/> **Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.
> <br/> **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its 
<br/>    wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon 
<br/>    must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or 
<br/>    take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be 
<br/>    knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its 
<br/>    flying speed.
